## Connect to the AMI 430 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to an AMI 430 Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.american_magnetics.AMI430 import AMI430

# Create an instance of the AMI430 instrument
ami430 = AMI430("ami430", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7180::SOCKET")

# Connect to the instrument
ami430.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the power supply
# For example, you can set the field to 1 Tesla
ami430.field(1)

# You can also read the current field value
current_field = ami430.field()

# Disconnect from the instrument
ami430.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7180::SOCKET"` with the actual IP address and port of your AMI 430 Power Supply.
