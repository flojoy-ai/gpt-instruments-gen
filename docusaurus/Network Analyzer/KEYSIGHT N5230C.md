### Qcodes

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N5230C import Keysight_N5230C

# Connect to the N5230C Network Analyzer
n5230c = Keysight_N5230C('n5230c', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Perform operations using the instrument
n5230c.connect()
n5230c.get_idn()
n5230c.set_frequency(1e9)
n5230c.set_power(-10)
n5230c.measure('S21')
n5230c.get_data('S21')
n5230c.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your N5230C Network Analyzer.
