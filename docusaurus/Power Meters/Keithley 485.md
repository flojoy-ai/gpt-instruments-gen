## Instrument Card

The Keithley 485 Autoranging Picoammeter provides 100fA sensitivity with 4 1/2-digit resolution in a low-cost, highly sensitive, easy-to-use instrument. The 485 measures DC current on seven ranges covering 10 decades from 100fA to 2mA. The input can withstand overloads as high as 1000V (with 100kÎ© limiting resistor) for flexibility in a wide range of applications in test, research, and student labs. An analog output linearly converts the incoming current to voltage for hard copy output or control loop applications.

## Connect to the Keithley 485 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit


```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 485 picoammeter
inst = ik.keithley.Keithley485.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)

# Set the input range to 2e-9 A
inst.input_range = "2e-9"

# Enable zero check mode
inst.zero_check = True

# Enable log mode
inst.log = True

# Enable relative mode
inst.relative = True

# Set the trigger mode to continuous on talk
inst.trigger_mode = "continuous_ontalk"

# Perform a current measurement
measurement = inst.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(measurement)
```

This script connects to the Keithley 485 picoammeter using the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.keithley.Keithley485` class. It then sets various properties of the picoammeter, such as the input range, zero check mode, log mode, relative mode, and trigger mode. Finally, it performs a current measurement using the `measure` method and prints the result.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library and have the necessary permissions to access the GPIB device at `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
