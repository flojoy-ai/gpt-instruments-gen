## Connect to the  (Series --> Infiniium oscilloscopes) in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a Keysight Infiniium oscilloscope using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_6000 import Keysight_6000

# Create an instance of the Keysight_6000 driver
scope = Keysight_6000("scope", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope.connect()

# Print the IDN of the oscilloscope
print(scope.IDN())

# Perform other operations with the oscilloscope

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual VISA address of your oscilloscope.
