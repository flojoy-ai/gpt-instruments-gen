## Connect to the WaveMaster / SDA /DDA 8 Zi-B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a WaveMaster / SDA / DDA 8 Zi-B Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
address = "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa(address)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

oscilloscope.time_div = 20 * ik.units.ns

channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
channel.trace = True
channel.coupling = channel.Coupling.dc50
channel.scale = 1 * ik.units.V

xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified address using the `open_visa` method from the `ik.teledyne.MAUI` module. It then performs various operations on the oscilloscope, such as starting the trigger in automatic mode, setting the timebase to 20 ns per division, and reading a waveform from the first channel.

Note: Make sure to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your oscilloscope.
