## Instrument Card

The WaveSurfer 510 combines the MAUI with OneTouch user interface with powerful waveform processing, in addition to advanced math, measurement, and debug tools, to quickly analyze and find the root cause of problems. The 12.1‚Äù touch-screen display of the WaveSurfer 510 is the largest in its class and makes viewing waveform abnormalities fast and easy.

## Connect to the WaveSurfer 510 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a WaveSurfer 510 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can read the waveform from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Print the waveform data
print("X Data:", xdat)
print("Y Data:", ydat)
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified IP address ("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR") using the VISA protocol. It then reads the waveform data from the first channel and prints the X and Y data.

Note: Make sure to replace "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR" with the actual IP address of your WaveSurfer 510 Oscilloscope.
