## Connect to the KEYSIGHT N9000A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to a KEYSIGHT N9000A Spectrum Analyzer using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N9000A import Keysight_N9000A

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the KEYSIGHT N9000A Spectrum Analyzer
n9000a = Keysight_N9000A('n9000a', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(n9000a)

# Print the instrument ID
print(n9000a.IDN())

# Close the connection
n9000a.close()
```

This script creates a station to hold the instrument, connects to the KEYSIGHT N9000A Spectrum Analyzer using the `Keysight_N9000A` driver, adds the instrument to the station, prints the instrument ID, and then closes the connection.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your KEYSIGHT N9000A Spectrum Analyzer.
