## Connect to the Bristol 771  in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumental

```python
Based on the provided code, it seems that the Bristol 721 Spectrum Analyzer is supported by the Instrumental library. However, there is no specific support for the Bristol 771 Spectrum Analyzer mentioned in the code.

To connect to a Bristol 771 Spectrum Analyzer using Instrumental, you would need to modify the existing code or create a new driver specifically for the Bristol 771 model. This would involve understanding the communication protocol and commands required to interact with the device.

Without additional information or code specific to the Bristol 771 model, it is not possible to provide a complete solution for connecting to it using Instrumental.
