## Connect to the KEYSIGHT 33511B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a KEYSIGHT 33511B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('signal_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect_message()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the signal generator
# For example, you can set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz
signal_generator.ch1.frequency(1e6)

# You can also read the current frequency setting
frequency = signal_generator.ch1.frequency()
print(f"The current frequency is: {frequency} Hz")

# Don't forget to close the connection when you're done
signal_generator.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your KEYSIGHT 33511B RF Signal Generator.
