# SG 380

## Instrument Card

The SG380 Series RF Signal Generators use a unique, innovative architecture (Rational Approximation Frequency Synthesis) to deliver ultra-high frequency resolution (1 µHz), excellent phase noise, and versatile modulation capabilities (AM, FM, ØM, pulse modulation and sweeps) at a fraction of the cost of competing designs. The standard models produce sine waves from DC to 2.025 GHz (SG382), 4.05 GHz (SG384) and 6.075 GHz (SG386).

## Connect to the SG 380 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Pymeasure


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import SG380

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SG 380 RF Signal Generator
sg = SG380(adapter)

# Get the RF frequency
frequency = sg.frequency
print("RF Frequency:", frequency)

# Set the RF frequency to 1 GHz
sg.frequency = 1E9

# Get the modulation type
mod_type = sg.mod_type
print("Modulation Type:", mod_type)

# Set the modulation type to AM
sg.mod_type = 'AM'

# Get the modulation function
mod_function = sg.mod_function
print("Modulation Function:", mod_function)

# Set the modulation function to SINE
sg.mod_function = 'SINE'

# Close the connection to the instrument
sg.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the SG 380 RF Signal Generator using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `SG380` class. It then demonstrates how to get and set various properties of the instrument, such as the RF frequency, modulation type, and modulation function. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
