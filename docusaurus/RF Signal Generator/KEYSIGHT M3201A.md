## Connect to the KEYSIGHT M3201A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to a KEYSIGHT M3201A RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_M3201A import Keysight_M3201A

# Create an instance of the instrument
awg = Keysight_M3201A('awg', chassis=1, slot=7)

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument for various operations
# For example, you can set the output voltage of a channel
awg.channels[1].amplitude(0.5)  # Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V

# Disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Qcodes and the Keysight instrument driver.
