# SG 384

## Instrument Card

The SG380 Series RF Signal Generators use a unique, innovative architecture (Rational Approximation Frequency Synthesis) to deliver ultra-high frequency resolution (1 µHz), excellent phase noise, and versatile modulation capabilities (AM, FM, ØM, pulse modulation and sweeps) at a fraction of the cost of competing designs. The standard models produce sine waves from DC to 2.025 GHz (SG382), 4.05 GHz (SG384) and 6.075 GHz (SG386).

## Connect to the SG 384 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SG384 import SG384

# Connect to the SG384 RF Signal Generator
sg = SG384('sg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Set the frequency to 1 GHz
sg.frequency(1e9)

# Get the current frequency
frequency = sg.frequency()
print(frequency)

# Set the amplitude of the RF output to -10 dBm
sg.amplitude_RF(-10)

# Enable the RF output
sg.enable_RF('ON')

# Disable the BNC output
sg.enable_LF('OFF')

# Close the connection to the SG384 RF Signal Generator
sg.close()
```

This script connects to the SG384 RF Signal Generator using the IP address '192.168.1.1'. It sets the frequency to 1 GHz, gets the current frequency, sets the amplitude of the RF output to -10 dBm, enables the RF output, and disables the BNC output. Finally, it closes the connection to the SG384 RF Signal Generator.
