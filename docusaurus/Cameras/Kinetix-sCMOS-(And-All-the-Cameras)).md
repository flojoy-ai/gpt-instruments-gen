## Connect to the Kinetix sCMOS (And All the Cameras)) in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumental

```python
Unfortunately, the provided code does not include any implementation for connecting to a Kinetix sCMOS camera or any other camera. The code is a driver for Photometrics cameras and specifically for PVCam cameras. It provides a class `PVCam` that inherits from `Camera` and includes methods for camera initialization, capturing images, and other camera operations.

To connect to a Kinetix sCMOS camera or any other camera, you would need to have the appropriate driver or library for that specific camera model. The code provided does not include the necessary implementation for connecting to a Kinetix sCMOS camera.

If you have the appropriate driver or library for the Kinetix sCMOS camera, you would need to write a separate code that utilizes that driver or library to connect to the camera and perform operations such as capturing images. The specific code for connecting to the Kinetix sCMOS camera would depend on the API or interface provided by the camera manufacturer.

Without the specific driver or library for the Kinetix sCMOS camera, it is not possible to provide a complete code example for connecting to and using the camera.
