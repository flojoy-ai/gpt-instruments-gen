## Connect to the KEYSIGHT 34934A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a KEYSIGHT 34934A DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import VisaInstrument

# Connect to the KEYSIGHT 34934A DAQ board
daq_board = VisaInstrument('DAQ_board', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the relay protection mode
print(daq_board.protection_mode())

# Set the relay protection mode to 'AUTO100'
daq_board.protection_mode('AUTO100')

# Convert (row, column) pairs to channel numbers
channel_list = daq_board.to_channel_list([(1, 2), (3, 4)], 'MH')
print(channel_list)

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq_board.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your KEYSIGHT 34934A DAQ board.

This script connects to the KEYSIGHT 34934A DAQ board using the VISA address `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'`. It then retrieves and prints the current relay protection mode using `daq_board.protection_mode()`. The relay protection mode is set to `'AUTO100'` using `daq_board.protection_mode('AUTO100')`. The `to_channel_list` method is used to convert the `(row, column)` pairs `[(1, 2), (3, 4)]` to channel numbers. Finally, the script closes the connection to the DAQ board using `daq_board.close()`.
