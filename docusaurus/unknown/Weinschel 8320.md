## Connect to the Weinschel 8320 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

Here's a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Weinschel 8320 attenuator:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument

# Create an instance of the Weinschel8320 instrument
weinschel = Weinschel8320('weinschel', 'your_visa_address')

# Connect to the instrument
weinschel.connect()

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
weinschel.attenuation(10)

# Get the current attenuation value
attenuation_value = weinschel.attenuation()

# Print the current attenuation value
print(f"Current attenuation: {attenuation_value} dB")

# Disconnect from the instrument
weinschel.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'your_visa_address'` with the actual VISA address of your Weinschel 8320 attenuator.
