## Connect to the ATS 545 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Pymeasure


```python
from pymeasure.instruments.temptronic.temptronic_ats545 import ATS545

# Connect to the ATS 545 Temperature Controller
ts = ATS545('ASRL3::INSTR')  # Replace 'ASRL3::INSTR' with the appropriate adapter address

# Configure the Temperature Controller
ts.configure()  # Basic configuration (defaults to T-DUT)

# Start the flow
ts.start()  # Starts the flow (head position not changed)

# Set the temperature to 25 degrees Celsius
ts.set_temperature(25)  # Sets the temperature to 25 degC

# Wait for the temperature to settle
ts.wait_for_settling()  # Blocks script execution and polls for settling

# Shutdown the Temperature Controller
ts.shutdown(head=False)  # Disables the thermostream, keeps head down
```

This script connects to the ATS 545 Temperature Controller using the specified adapter address. It then configures the Temperature Controller, starts the flow, sets the temperature to 25 degrees Celsius, waits for the temperature to settle, and finally shuts down the Temperature Controller.
