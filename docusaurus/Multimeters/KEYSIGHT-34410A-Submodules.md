## Connect to the KEYSIGHT 34410A Submodules in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight_34410A

# Create an instance of the Keysight 34410A driver
meter = Keysight_34410A('meter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
meter.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
meter.disconnect()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight_34410A` driver. It then connects to the instrument using the specified address. After performing any desired measurements or operations, it disconnects from the instrument.
