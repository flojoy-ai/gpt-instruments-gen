## Connect to the HP 3437A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Pymeasure


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import PrologixAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.hp import HP3437A

# Create a PrologixAdapter object to connect to the instrument
adapter = PrologixAdapter("GPIB0::10::INSTR")

# Create an HP3437A object using the adapter
multimeter = HP3437A(adapter)

# Open the connection to the instrument
multimeter.open()

# Perform measurements or set instrument properties here

# Close the connection to the instrument
multimeter.close()
```

This script creates a `PrologixAdapter` object to connect to the instrument using the GPIB interface. Then, it creates an `HP3437A` object using the adapter. The `open()` method is called to establish the connection to the instrument. You can perform measurements or set instrument properties between the `open()` and `close()` calls. Finally, the `close()` method is called to close the connection to the instrument.

Please note that you need to have the `pymeasure` package installed in order to run this script.
