To connect to a FJ Series Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import FJPowerSupply

# Create an instance of the FJPowerSupply class
power_supply = FJPowerSupply()

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Check if the power supply is connected
if power_supply.is_connected():
    print("Connected to FJ Series Power Supply")
else:
    print("Failed to connect to FJ Series Power Supply")

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Make sure you have Instrumentkit installed before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Replace the `FJPowerSupply` class with the appropriate class for your specific FJ Series Power Supply model.
