To connect to a WaveRunner 8000HD Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.WaveRunner8000HD.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can read the waveform from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified IP address ("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR") using the VISA backend. It then performs operations on the oscilloscope, such as reading the waveform from a channel. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.

Note: The code assumes that you have already installed Instrumentkit and its dependencies.
