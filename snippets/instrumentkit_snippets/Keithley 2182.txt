Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 2182 Power Meter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley2182.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to DC voltage
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.voltage_dc

# Set the input range to auto
power_meter.input_range = 'auto'

# Perform a measurement
measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(f"Measurement: {measurement}")

# Close the connection to the power meter
power_meter.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Keithley 2182 Power Meter. You can find the correct serial port by checking your system's device manager or using a serial port monitoring tool.

This script connects to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter, sets the measurement mode to DC voltage, sets the input range to auto, performs a measurement, and prints the measurement result. Finally, it closes the connection to the power meter.

Note that you may need to install the `instrumentkit` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```
