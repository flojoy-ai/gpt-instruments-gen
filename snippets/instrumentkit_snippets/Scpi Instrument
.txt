Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a SCPI instrument:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the SCPI instrument
inst = ik.SCPIInstrument.open_tcpip('192.168.0.2', 8888)

# Get the name of the connected instrument
name = inst.name
print(name)

# Get the SCPI version supported by the instrument
scpi_version = inst.scpi_version
print(scpi_version)

# Check if all operations sent to the instrument have been completed
op_complete = inst.op_complete
print(op_complete)

# Get the power on status of the instrument
power_on_status = inst.power_on_status
print(power_on_status)

# Set the power on status of the instrument
inst.power_on_status = True

# Get the self test result of the instrument
self_test_ok = inst.self_test_ok
print(self_test_ok)

# Reset the instrument
inst.reset()

# Clear the instrument
inst.clear()

# Send a software trigger event to the instrument
inst.trigger()

# Instruct the instrument to wait until it has completed all received commands before continuing
inst.wait_to_continue()

# Get the power line frequency setting of the instrument
line_frequency = inst.line_frequency
print(line_frequency)

# Set the power line frequency setting of the instrument
inst.line_frequency = 50

# Check and clear the error queue of the instrument
error_queue = inst.check_error_queue()
print(error_queue)

# Get the brightness of the display on the instrument
display_brightness = inst.display_brightness
print(display_brightness)

# Set the brightness of the display on the instrument
inst.display_brightness = 0.5

# Get the contrast of the display on the instrument
display_contrast = inst.display_contrast
print(display_contrast)

# Set the contrast of the display on the instrument
inst.display_contrast = 0.8

# Close the connection to the instrument
inst.close()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to a SCPI instrument using Instrumentkit and perform various operations such as getting the instrument name, checking the power on status, setting the power line frequency, checking and clearing the error queue, and adjusting the display brightness and contrast.
