To connect to a SCPI instrument using Instrumentkit, you can use the `Instrument` class from the `instrumentkit` module. Here's an example script that demonstrates how to connect to a SCPI instrument:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument

# Create an instance of the Instrument class
instrument = Instrument()

# Connect to the SCPI instrument
instrument.connect('IP_ADDRESS', PORT)

# Send SCPI commands to the instrument
instrument.send_command('COMMAND')

# Receive and print the response from the instrument
response = instrument.receive_response()
print(response)

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

Replace `'IP_ADDRESS'` with the IP address of your SCPI instrument and `PORT` with the appropriate port number. Replace `'COMMAND'` with the SCPI command you want to send to the instrument.

Note that you may need to install the `instrumentkit` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Make sure to consult the documentation of your specific SCPI instrument to find the correct IP address, port, and SCPI commands to use.
