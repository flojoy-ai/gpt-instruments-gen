To connect to a DS345 Function Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik
import instrumentkit.devices.srs as srs

# Connect to the DS345 Function Generator
srs345 = srs.SRS345.open_gpib('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the frequency to 1 MHz
srs345.frequency = 1 * ik.units.MHz

# Get the offset voltage
offset_voltage = srs345.offset

# Set the output function to triangle
srs345.function = srs345.Function.triangle
```

This script imports the necessary modules from Instrumentkit and specifically imports the `SRS345` class from the `instrumentkit.devices.srs` module. It then connects to the DS345 Function Generator using the `open_gpib` method, specifying the appropriate device address.

Once connected, you can interact with the function generator by setting and getting various properties. In the example script, it sets the frequency to 1 MHz using the `frequency` property, gets the offset voltage using the `offset` property, and sets the output function to triangle using the `function` property.

Note that the script assumes you have Instrumentkit and its dependencies installed.
