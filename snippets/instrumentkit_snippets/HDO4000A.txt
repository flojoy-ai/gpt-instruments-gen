To connect to a HDO4000A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import Scope

# Create a Scope object and connect to the oscilloscope
scope = Scope("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")  # Replace with the actual IP address of the oscilloscope

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
scope.set_channel_enabled(1, True)  # Enable channel 1
scope.set_channel_scale(1, 0.1)  # Set channel 1 scale to 0.1 V/div
scope.set_timebase_scale(1e-6)  # Set timebase scale to 1 us/div

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual IP address of your HDO4000A Oscilloscope. This script connects to the oscilloscope, enables channel 1, sets the scale for channel 1 to 0.1 V/div, and sets the timebase scale to 1 us/div. Finally, it disconnects from the oscilloscope.

Note: The above script assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package. You can install it using `pip install instrumentkit`.
