Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to an Oxford ITC 503 Temperature Controller:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller
itc = ik.oxford.OxfordITC503.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Read the temperature from the first sensor
temperature = itc.sensor[0].temperature
print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} K")

# Close the connection
itc.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your ITC 503 Temperature Controller. The second argument `1` is the GPIB address of the instrument.

This script connects to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller, reads the temperature from the first sensor, and then closes the connection. The temperature is printed with two decimal places.
