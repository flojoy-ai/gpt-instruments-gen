Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a CC1 Coincidence Counter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the CC1 Coincidence Counter
cc1 = ik.qubitekk.CC1.open_serial('COM8', 19200, timeout=1)

# Read the firmware version
firmware_version = cc1.firmware
print(f"Firmware version: {firmware_version}")

# Set the dwell time to 1 second
cc1.dwell_time = 1

# Set the coincidence window to 10 ns
cc1.window = 10

# Enable the gate
cc1.gate = True

# Enable subtract
cc1.subtract = True

# Set the trigger mode to continuous
cc1.trigger_mode = 'continuous'

# Read the counts for each channel
for i, channel in enumerate(cc1.channel):
    count = channel.count
    print(f"Channel {i+1} count: {count}")

# Clear the counts
cc1.clear_counts()

# Close the connection
cc1.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'COM8'` with the correct serial port for your CC1 Coincidence Counter.
