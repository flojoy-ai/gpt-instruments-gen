To connect to a CC1 Coincidence Counter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import qubitekk

# Connect to the CC1 Coincidence Counter
cc1 = qubitekk.CC1.open_serial('COM8', 19200, timeout=1)

# Access the properties and methods of the CC1 Coincidence Counter
print(cc1.firmware)
print(cc1.dwell_time)

cc1.dwell_time = 0.5  # Set the dwell time to 0.5 seconds

cc1.clear_counts()  # Clear the current total counts on the counters

# Access the counts of each channel
for channel in cc1.channel:
    print(channel.count)

# Disconnect from the CC1 Coincidence Counter
cc1.close()
```

This script imports the `qubitekk` module from Instrumentkit and uses the `open_serial` method to connect to the CC1 Coincidence Counter using the specified serial port and baud rate. It then demonstrates accessing the properties and methods of the CC1 Coincidence Counter, such as getting the firmware version, getting and setting the dwell time, clearing the counts, and accessing the counts of each channel. Finally, it closes the connection to the CC1 Coincidence Counter using the `close` method.
