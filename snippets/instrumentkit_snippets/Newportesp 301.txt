To connect to a Newport ESP-301 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
from instrumentkit import NewportESP301

# Connect to the controller
controller = NewportESP301.open_serial("COM3")

# Access the axis of the controller
axis = controller.axis[0]

# Move the axis to a specific position
axis.move(0.001, absolute=False)

# Wait for the motion to finish
axis.wait_for_motion()

# Disconnect from the controller
controller.close()
```

This code connects to the Newport ESP-301 controller using the `open_serial` method, which takes the serial port as an argument. It then accesses the first axis of the controller using `controller.axis[0]`. You can perform various operations on the axis, such as moving it to a specific position using the `move` method, waiting for the motion to finish using the `wait_for_motion` method, and closing the connection using the `close` method.
