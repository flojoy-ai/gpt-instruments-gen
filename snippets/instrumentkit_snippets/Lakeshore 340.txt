To connect to a Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller
inst = ik.lakeshore.Lakeshore340.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Read the temperature from the first sensor
temperature = inst.sensor[0].temperature
print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} K")

# Read the temperature from the second sensor
temperature = inst.sensor[1].temperature
print(f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f} K")

# Close the connection
inst.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller. The second argument `1` represents the GPIB address of the instrument.

This script connects to the Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller, reads the temperature from the first and second sensors, and then closes the connection. The temperature is printed in Kelvin.
