To connect to a Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Lakeshore 340 Temperature Controller
inst = ik.lakeshore.Lakeshore340.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Read the temperature of the first sensor
temperature = inst.sensor[0].temperature
print(temperature)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Lakeshore340` class to connect to the Temperature Controller. The `open_gpibusb` method takes the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the GPIB address (`1`) as arguments.

After connecting, the script reads the temperature of the first sensor by accessing the `temperature` property of the `sensor[0]` object. The temperature is then printed to the console.
