To connect to a Keithley 195 Multimeter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 195 Multimeter
dmm = ik.keithley.Keithley195.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Perform a measurement
measurement = dmm.measure(dmm.Mode.resistance)

# Print the measurement result
print(measurement)
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.keithley.Keithley195` class to connect to the Keithley 195 Multimeter. The `open_gpibusb` method takes the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the GPIB address (`12`) as arguments.

After connecting, you can use the `measure` method to perform a measurement. In this example, the measurement mode is set to resistance (`dmm.Mode.resistance`), but you can change it to other modes like voltage_dc or current_dc.

Finally, the measurement result is printed to the console.
