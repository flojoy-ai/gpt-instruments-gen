Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 195 Multimeter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 195 Multimeter
dmm = ik.keithley.Keithley195.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to resistance
dmm.mode = dmm.Mode.resistance

# Perform a measurement
measurement = dmm.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(f"Measurement: {measurement}")
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Keithley 195 Multimeter.
