To connect to a WaveRunner 9000 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can read the waveform from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Print the waveform data
print("X Data:", xdat)
print("Y Data:", ydat)
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified IP address ("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR") using the VISA protocol. It then reads the waveform data from the first channel and prints the X and Y data.

Note: The IP address used in the code is just an example. You need to replace it with the actual IP address of your WaveRunner 9000 Oscilloscope.
