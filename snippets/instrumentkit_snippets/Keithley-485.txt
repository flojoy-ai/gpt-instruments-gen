To connect to a Keithley 485 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 485 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley485.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to power
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.power

# Measure the power
power_measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the power measurement
print(power_measurement)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.keithley.Keithley485` class to connect to the Keithley 485 Power Meter. It then sets the measurement mode to power using the `mode` property and measures the power using the `measure` method. Finally, it prints the power measurement.
