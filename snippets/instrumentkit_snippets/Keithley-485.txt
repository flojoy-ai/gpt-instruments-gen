Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 485 picoammeter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 485 picoammeter
inst = ik.keithley.Keithley485.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)

# Set the input range to 2e-9 A
inst.input_range = "2e-9"

# Enable zero check mode
inst.zero_check = True

# Enable log mode
inst.log = True

# Enable relative mode
inst.relative = True

# Perform a current measurement
measurement = inst.measure()
print(measurement)
```

This script first imports the `instrumentkit` module and then uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Keithley485` class to connect to the Keithley 485 picoammeter. The method takes the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the GPIB address (22) as arguments.

Next, the script sets the input range to 2e-9 A using the `input_range` property of the instrument. It then enables zero check mode, log mode, and relative mode using the corresponding properties.

Finally, the script performs a current measurement using the `measure` method of the instrument and prints the result.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library and have the necessary permissions to access the GPIB device.
