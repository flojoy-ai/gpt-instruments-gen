To connect to a Keithley 6220 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 6220 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley6220.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Perform a measurement
measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(measurement)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.keithley.Keithley6220` class to connect to the Keithley 6220 Power Meter. The `open_gpibusb` method takes the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the GPIB address (12) as arguments.

After connecting to the power meter, the script calls the `measure` method to perform a measurement. The measurement result is stored in the `measurement` variable.

Finally, the script prints the measurement result using the `print` function.
