Here is a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a AVS 47 Temperature Controllers:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the AVS 47 Temperature Controller
bridge = ik.picowatt.PicowattAVS47.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Get the resistance of the first sensor
resistance = bridge.sensor[0].resistance

# Print the resistance
print(resistance)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik`. It then uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `PicowattAVS47` class to connect to the AVS 47 Temperature Controller. The method takes the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the GPIB address (`1`) as arguments.

After connecting to the controller, the script retrieves the resistance of the first sensor by accessing the `resistance` property of the `Sensor` object. Finally, it prints the resistance value.
