To connect to a Tektronix AWG2005 RF Signal Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the `TekAWG2000` class from the provided code example. Here's a Python script that demonstrates how to connect to the AWG2005 and set the amplitude and frequency of a specific channel:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the AWG2005
awg = ik.tektronix.TekAWG2000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 1 Vpp
awg.channel[0].amplitude = 1

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz
awg.channel[0].frequency = 1e3

# Disconnect from the AWG2005
awg.close()
```

Make sure to replace `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` with the appropriate device path for your AWG2005. Also, note that the AWG2005 has two channels, so you can access the second channel using `awg.channel[1]` if needed.

This script demonstrates how to connect to the AWG2005, set the amplitude of channel 1 to 1 Vpp, and set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz. You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements.
