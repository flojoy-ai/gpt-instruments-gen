Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a AWG2005 RF Signal Generator:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg = ik.tektronix.TekAWG2000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 1 V
awg.channel[0].amplitude = 1

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz
awg.channel[0].frequency = 1e6

# Set the waveform shape of channel 1 to sine
awg.channel[0].shape = awg.Shape.sine

# Upload a waveform to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
yzero = 0
ymult = 1
xincr = 1
waveform = [0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0, -0.5, -1, -0.5]  # Example waveform data
awg.upload_waveform(yzero, ymult, xincr, waveform)

# Set the waveform name to "my_waveform"
awg.waveform_name = "my_waveform"

# Disconnect from the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg.close()
```

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library and its dependencies.
