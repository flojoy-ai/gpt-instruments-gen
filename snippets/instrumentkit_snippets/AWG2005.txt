To connect to a AWG2005 RF Signal Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg = ik.tektronix.TekAWG2000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Access the desired channel
channel = awg.channel[0]

# Set the amplitude of the channel
channel.amplitude = 1.5  # Set amplitude to 1.5 V

# Set the frequency of the channel
channel.frequency = 1e6  # Set frequency to 1 MHz

# Set the waveform shape of the channel
channel.shape = awg.Shape.sine  # Set waveform shape to sine

# Disconnect from the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg.close()
```

This script connects to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator using the `open_gpibusb` method from the `TekAWG2000` class in the `tektronix` module of Instrumentkit. It then accesses the first channel of the AWG2005 using `awg.channel[0]`. The script sets the amplitude, frequency, and waveform shape of the channel using the properties `channel.amplitude`, `channel.frequency`, and `channel.shape` respectively. Finally, it closes the connection to the AWG2005 using `awg.close()`.
