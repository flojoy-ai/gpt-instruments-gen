To connect to a WaveMaster / SDA / DDA 8 Zi-B Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
address = "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa(address)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

# Close the connection
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified address using the `open_visa` method from the `ik.teledyne.MAUI` module. It then performs some operations on the oscilloscope, such as starting the trigger and printing the trigger state. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method.

Note: Replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your oscilloscope.
