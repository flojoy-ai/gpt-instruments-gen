To connect to a TDS224 using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the TDS224
tds224 = instrumentkit.connect('TDS224')

# Perform operations on the TDS224
# ...

# Close the connection
tds224.close()
```

Please note that the above code assumes that you have already installed Instrumentkit library. If not, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Replace the `# Perform operations on the TDS224` comment with the specific operations you want to perform on the TDS224, such as reading measurements or configuring settings.
