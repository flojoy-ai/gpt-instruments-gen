To connect to a WaveSurfer 3000z Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.WaveSurfer3000z.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

# Close the connection
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` library and uses the `open_visa` method of the `WaveSurfer3000z` class to connect to the oscilloscope. You need to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"` with the actual VISA address of your oscilloscope.

Once connected, you can perform operations on the oscilloscope. In this example, the `run` method is called to start the oscilloscope's trigger, and then the `trigger_state` property is printed to display the current trigger state.

Finally, the `close` method is called to close the connection to the oscilloscope.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` library and its dependencies.
