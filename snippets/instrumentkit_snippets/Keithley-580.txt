To connect to a Keithley 580 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 580 Power Meter
keithley = ik.keithley.Keithley580.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the polarity to positive
keithley.polarity = keithley.Polarity.positive

# Set the drive mode to pulsed
keithley.drive = keithley.Drive.pulsed

# Enable the dry circuit test mode
keithley.dry_circuit_test = True

# Enable the operate mode
keithley.operate = True

# Set the input range to auto
keithley.input_range = "auto"

# Perform a measurement
measurement = keithley.measure()
print(f"Resistance: {measurement}")

# Close the connection
keithley.close()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 580 Power Meter using the `open_gpibusb` method, sets various properties of the instrument such as polarity, drive mode, dry circuit test mode, operate mode, and input range, performs a measurement using the `measure` method, and then closes the connection using the `close` method. The measured resistance is printed to the console.
