To connect to a Keysight E3631A Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the power supply
psu = ik.hp.HPe3631a.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 10)

# Set the channel to P25V
psu.channelid = 2

# Set the output voltage to 12.5V
psu.voltage = 12.5

# Read back the set voltage
print(psu.voltage)

# Read back the sensed voltage
print(psu.voltage_sense)
```

This script first imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik`. Then, it connects to the power supply using the `open_gpibusb` method of the `HPe3631a` class, specifying the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the GPIB address (`10`).

Next, it sets the active channel to `P25V` by assigning `2` to the `channelid` property of the power supply object (`psu`).

Then, it sets the output voltage to `12.5V` by assigning `12.5` to the `voltage` property of the power supply object.

Finally, it reads back the set voltage by accessing the `voltage` property and prints it. It also reads back the sensed voltage by accessing the `voltage_sense` property and prints it.
