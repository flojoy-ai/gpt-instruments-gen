To connect to a Keysight E3631A Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, SCPIInstrument

# Define the IP address and port of the power supply
ip_address = '192.168.1.100'
port = 5025

# Create a SCPIInstrument object for the power supply
power_supply = SCPIInstrument(ip_address, port)

# Open the connection to the power supply
power_supply.open()

# Query the power supply identification
identification = power_supply.query('*IDN?')
print(f'Connected to: {identification}')

# Set the output voltage of channel 1 to 5V
power_supply.write('VOLT:LEV:IMM:AMPL 5, (@1)')

# Set the output current of channel 1 to 1A
power_supply.write('CURR:LEV:IMM:AMPL 1, (@1)')

# Enable the output of channel 1
power_supply.write('OUTP ON, (@1)')

# Close the connection to the power supply
power_supply.close()
```

Make sure to replace the `ip_address` variable with the actual IP address of your Keysight E3631A Power Supply. Also, ensure that the power supply is connected to the network and accessible from your computer.

This script connects to the power supply, sets the output voltage and current of channel 1, enables the output, and then closes the connection. You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements.
