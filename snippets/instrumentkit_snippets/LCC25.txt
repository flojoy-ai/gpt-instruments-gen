Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a LCC25 Power Supply:

```python
from instrumentkit import ThorlabsPM100USB

# Connect to the power meter
power_meter = ThorlabsPM100USB()

# Read the measurement from the power meter
measurement = power_meter.read()

# Print the measurement
print(f"Measurement: {measurement}")
```

In this script, we import the `ThorlabsPM100USB` class from the `instrumentkit` module. We then create an instance of the `ThorlabsPM100USB` class called `power_meter`. This will automatically connect to the power meter.

We can then use the `read()` method of the `power_meter` object to read a measurement from the power meter. The measurement is returned as a `pint.Quantity` object, which represents a numerical value with associated units.

Finally, we print the measurement to the console using f-string formatting.
