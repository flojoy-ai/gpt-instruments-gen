Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a LCC25 Power Supply:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, ConnectionType
from instrumentkit.contrib.thorlabs import LCC25

# Connect to the LCC25 Power Supply
instrument = Instrument(
    LCC25,
    connection_type=ConnectionType.SERIAL,
    port="COM1",  # Replace with the actual serial port
    baudrate=9600,  # Replace with the actual baudrate
)

# Initialize the instrument
instrument.initialize()

# Get the name and version number of the device
name = instrument.name
print(f"Device Name: {name}")

# Set the frequency at which the LCC oscillates between the two voltages
frequency = 10  # Hz
instrument.frequency = frequency

# Set the output mode of the LCC25
mode = LCC25.Mode.voltage1
instrument.mode = mode

# Enable the output
instrument.enable = True

# Set the voltage values for output 1 and output 2
voltage1 = 10  # Volts
voltage2 = 20  # Volts
instrument.voltage1 = voltage1
instrument.voltage2 = voltage2

# Perform other operations as needed

# Close the connection to the instrument
instrument.close()
```

Note: Replace `"COM1"` with the actual serial port that the LCC25 Power Supply is connected to, and replace `9600` with the actual baudrate if it's different.
