To connect to a WavePro HD Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.WaveProHD.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can read the waveform from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Print the waveform data
print("X Data:", xdat)
print("Y Data:", ydat)

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code connects to a WavePro HD Oscilloscope at the specified IP address ("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"). It then reads the waveform data from the first channel and prints it. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.

Note: Make sure to replace "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR" with the actual IP address of your oscilloscope.
