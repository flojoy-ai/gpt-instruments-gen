To connect to a FJ Series Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the `GlassmanFR` class from the `instruments.glassman.glassmanfr` module. Here's an example script:

```python
import instruments as ik

# Connect to the power supply
psu = ik.glassman.GlassmanFR.open_serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)

# Set the output voltage to 100V
psu.voltage = 100

# Turn on the power supply
psu.output = True

# Read the output voltage
voltage = psu.voltage
print(voltage)
```

This script first imports the `instruments` module from Instrumentkit. Then, it creates an instance of the `GlassmanFR` class by calling the `open_serial` method and passing the serial port and baud rate as arguments.

Next, it sets the output voltage of the power supply to 100V by assigning a value to the `voltage` property of the `psu` object.

After that, it turns on the power supply by assigning `True` to the `output` property of the `psu` object.

Finally, it reads the output voltage by accessing the `voltage` property of the `psu` object and prints the result.

Note that you may need to modify the serial port and baud rate values according to your specific setup.
