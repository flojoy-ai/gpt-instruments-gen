To connect to a Keithley 195 Multimeter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 195 Multimeter
dmm = ik.keithley.Keithley195.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to resistance
dmm.mode = dmm.Mode.resistance

# Perform a measurement
measurement = dmm.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(measurement)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.keithley.Keithley195` class to connect to the Keithley 195 Multimeter. It then sets the measurement mode to resistance using the `mode` property and performs a measurement using the `measure` method. Finally, it prints the measurement result.
