To connect to a LPS710E(/M) Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the LPS710E(/M) Positional Controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.LPS710E.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the channel object for channel 1
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled = True

# Set the position of the channel to 1000 steps
channel.position = 1000

# Move the channel to the specified position
channel.move()

# Disconnect from the controller
controller.close()
```

This code connects to the LPS710E(/M) Positional Controller using the `open_serial` method, specifying the serial port and baud rate. It then gets the channel object for channel 1 and enables it. The position of the channel is set to 1000 steps, and then the channel is moved to the specified position using the `move` method. Finally, the code closes the connection to the controller using the `close` method.
