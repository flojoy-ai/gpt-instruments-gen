To connect to a LPS710E(/M) Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the LPS710E(/M) Positional Controller
controller = instrumentkit.connect('LPS710E')

# Perform operations on the controller
# For example, you can get the current position
position = controller.get_position()
print(f"Current position: {position}")

# You can also move the controller to a specific position
target_position = 100.0
controller.move_to(target_position)

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.close()
```

Make sure you have Instrumentkit installed in your Python environment before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Replace `'LPS710E'` with the appropriate connection string for your specific controller.
