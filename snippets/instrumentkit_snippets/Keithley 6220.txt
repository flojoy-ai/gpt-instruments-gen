To connect to a Keithley 6220 Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 6220 Power Supply
ccs = ik.keithley.Keithley6220.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 10)

# Set the current to 10mA
ccs.current = 10 * ik.units.milliamp

# Disable the output and set the current to 0A
ccs.disable()
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Keithley6220` class to connect to the Keithley 6220 Power Supply. The first argument to `open_gpibusb` is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this example) and the second argument is the GPIB address (10 in this example).

Once connected, you can set the current using the `current` property of the `ccs` object. In this example, it sets the current to 10mA.

Finally, the `disable` method is called to turn off the output and set the current to 0A.
