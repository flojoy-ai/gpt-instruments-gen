Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 6220 Power Meter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 6220 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley6220.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to current
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.current

# Set the current range to 1 mA
power_meter.current_range = 1e-3

# Enable the output
power_meter.output_enabled = True

# Measure the current
current = power_meter.measure()

# Print the measured current
print(f"Measured current: {current}")

# Disable the output
power_meter.output_enabled = False

# Close the connection to the power meter
power_meter.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Keithley 6220 Power Meter. Also, adjust the measurement mode and range according to your needs.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library. If not, you can install it using `pip install instrumentkit`.
