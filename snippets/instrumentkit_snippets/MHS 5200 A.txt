Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a MHS 5200 A Function Generator:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the MHS 5200 A Function Generator
mhs = ik.minghe.MHS5200.open_serial(vid=1027, pid=24577, baud=19200, timeout=1)

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz
mhs.channel[0].frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 2 V peak-to-peak
mhs.channel[0].amplitude = 2, ik.VoltageMode.peak_to_peak

# Enable channel 1
mhs.channel[0].enable = True

# Disconnect from the MHS 5200 A Function Generator
mhs.close()
```

Explanation of the code:
- The `open_serial` function is used to connect to the MHS 5200 A Function Generator. It takes the Vendor ID (vid), Product ID (pid), baud rate, and timeout as arguments.
- The `frequency` property of a channel is used to set the frequency of the channel. In this example, we set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz.
- The `amplitude` property of a channel is used to set the amplitude of the channel. In this example, we set the amplitude of channel 1 to 2 V peak-to-peak.
- The `enable` property of a channel is used to enable or disable the channel. In this example, we enable channel 1.
- The `close` method is used to disconnect from the MHS 5200 A Function Generator.
