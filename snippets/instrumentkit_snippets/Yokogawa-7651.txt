To connect to a Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply
yokogawa = ik.yokogawa.Yokogawa7651.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the voltage to 10V
yokogawa.voltage = 10 * ik.units.V

# Set the current to 50mA
yokogawa.current = 50 * ik.units.mA

# Enable the output
yokogawa.channel[0].output = True

# Disable the output
yokogawa.channel[0].output = False
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Yokogawa7651` class to connect to the power supply. The first argument is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the second argument is the GPIB address (1).

Once connected, you can set the voltage and current using the `voltage` and `current` properties of the `Yokogawa7651` object. The values are specified using the `ik.units` module to provide the units (e.g., `10 * ik.units.V` for 10 volts).

You can also enable or disable the output using the `output` property of the power supply channel. Set it to `True` to enable the output and `False` to disable it.

Note that the script assumes you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
