To connect to a TDS500 Series Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the `tds500.TDS500` class. Here's an example Python script that connects to the oscilloscope and performs a simple measurement:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the TDS500 Oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.tektronix.tds500.TDS500.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Set the timebase and voltage scale
oscilloscope.timebase = 1e-6  # 1 microsecond per division
oscilloscope.channel[1].voltage_scale = 0.1  # 0.1 volts per division

# Trigger the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.trigger()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
oscilloscope.wait_for_acquisition()

# Read the waveform data from channel 1
waveform = oscilloscope.channel[1].get_waveform()

# Print the first 10 samples of the waveform
print(waveform[:10])
```

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
