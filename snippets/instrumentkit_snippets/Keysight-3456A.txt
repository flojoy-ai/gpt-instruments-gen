Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keysight 3456A Multimeter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter = ik.keysight.Keysight3456A.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)

# Set the measurement mode to DC voltage
multimeter.mode = multimeter.Mode.dcv

# Perform a measurement
measurement = multimeter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print("Measurement: {}".format(measurement))
```

This script first imports the `instrumentkit` module and then uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `ik.keysight.Keysight3456A` class to connect to the multimeter. You'll need to replace `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` with the appropriate device path for your system.

Next, it sets the measurement mode to DC voltage using the `mode` property of the multimeter object. In this example, we're using the `Mode.dcv` enum value.

Finally, it performs a measurement using the `measure` method of the multimeter object and prints the result.

Note that this script assumes you have already installed the `instrumentkit` library. If not, you can install it using `pip install instrumentkit`.
