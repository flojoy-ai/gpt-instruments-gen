To connect to a WaveRunner 9000 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can set the time per division
oscilloscope.time_div = 200 * ik.units.ns

# You can also read waveform data from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

Note: Replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"` with the actual VISA address of your WaveRunner 9000 Oscilloscope.
