To connect to a Keithley 2182 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter
meter = ik.keithley.Keithley2182.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 10)

# Perform a measurement
measurement = meter.measure(meter.Mode.voltage_dc)

# Print the measurement value
print(measurement)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Keithley2182` class to connect to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter. The first argument of `open_gpibusb` is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this example) and the second argument is the GPIB address (10 in this example).

After connecting to the power meter, the script performs a measurement using the `measure` method of the `Keithley2182` class. The measurement mode is specified as `meter.Mode.voltage_dc`, which represents the DC voltage measurement mode.

Finally, the script prints the measurement value.
