Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keysight 33220A RF Signal Generator:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik
import instrumentkit.keysight as keysight

# Connect to the instrument
inst = keysight.Keysight33220A.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the output function to sinusoid
inst.function = keysight.Keysight33220A.Function.sinusoid

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
inst.frequency = 1 * ik.units.kHz

# Enable the output
inst.output = True
```

This script imports the necessary modules from Instrumentkit and specifically from the `instrumentkit.keysight` module for the Keysight 33220A RF Signal Generator. It then connects to the instrument using the `open_gpibusb` method, specifying the device path and GPIB address.

The script sets the output function to sinusoid using the `function` property of the instrument object. It sets the frequency to 1 kHz using the `frequency` property, and enables the output using the `output` property.

Note that you may need to modify the device path and GPIB address to match your specific setup.
