To connect to a Rigol DS1000-Series Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import RigolDS1000Series

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = RigolDS1000Series.connect()

# Access the channels
channel1 = oscilloscope.channel[0]
channel2 = oscilloscope.channel[1]

# Set the acquisition type
oscilloscope.acquire_type = RigolDS1000Series.AcquisitionType.normal

# Set the number of averages
oscilloscope.acquire_averages = 8

# Force a trigger
oscilloscope.force_trigger()

# Start running the oscilloscope trigger
oscilloscope.run()

# Stop running the oscilloscope trigger
oscilloscope.stop()

# Release any lockout of the local control panel
oscilloscope.release_panel()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope, accesses the channels, sets the acquisition type and number of averages, forces a trigger, starts and stops the oscilloscope trigger, releases any lockout of the local control panel, and finally disconnects from the oscilloscope.
