Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 485 Power Meter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 485 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley485.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to power
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.power

# Set the range to auto
power_meter.input_range = 'auto'

# Measure the power
power_measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the power measurement
print(f"Power: {power_measurement}")

# Close the connection to the power meter
power_meter.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Keithley 485 Power Meter. You can also adjust the GPIB address (`12`) if necessary.

This script connects to the power meter, sets the measurement mode to power, sets the range to auto, measures the power, and then prints the power measurement. Finally, it closes the connection to the power meter.

Note that you may need to install the `instrumentkit` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
