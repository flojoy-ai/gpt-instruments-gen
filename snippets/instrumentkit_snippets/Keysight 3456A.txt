Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keysight 3456A Multimeter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter = ik.create_instrument("hp.hp3456a", "/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)

# Set the measurement mode to DC voltage
multimeter.mode = multimeter.Mode.dcv

# Perform a measurement
measurement = multimeter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print("Measurement: ", measurement)
```

In this script, we first import the `instrumentkit` module. Then, we use the `ik.create_instrument` function to create an instance of the `hp.hp3456a` instrument, specifying the serial port and GPIB address of the multimeter.

Next, we set the measurement mode to DC voltage by assigning the `multimeter.Mode.dcv` value to the `mode` property of the multimeter object.

Finally, we perform a measurement by calling the `measure` method of the multimeter object. The result is stored in the `measurement` variable, which we then print to the console.

Note: Make sure to replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the correct serial port of your multimeter, and `22` with the correct GPIB address.
