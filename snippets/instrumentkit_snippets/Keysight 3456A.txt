Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keysight 3456A Multimeter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter = ik.keysight.Keysight3456A.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)

# Set the measurement mode to DC voltage
multimeter.mode = multimeter.Mode.dcv

# Perform a measurement
measurement = multimeter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(f"Measurement: {measurement}")
```

In this script, we first import the `instrumentkit` module and then use the `open_gpibusb` method of the `ik.keysight.Keysight3456A` class to connect to the multimeter. You'll need to replace `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` with the appropriate device path for your system.

Next, we set the measurement mode to DC voltage by assigning the `multimeter.Mode.dcv` value to the `mode` property of the multimeter object.

Finally, we use the `measure` method of the multimeter object to perform a measurement and store the result in the `measurement` variable. We then print the measurement result.

Note that this script assumes you have already installed the `instrumentkit` library. If not, you can install it using `pip install instrumentkit`.
