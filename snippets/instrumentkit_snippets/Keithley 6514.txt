To connect to a Keithley 6514 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the Keithley 6514 Power Meter
power_meter = instrumentkit.connect('keithley6514', address='GPIB0::22::INSTR')

# Perform some measurements
voltage = power_meter.measure_voltage()
current = power_meter.measure_current()
power = power_meter.measure_power()

# Print the measurements
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Current: {current} A")
print(f"Power: {power} W")

# Close the connection
power_meter.close()
```

Make sure you have the `instrumentkit` package installed before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Replace `'GPIB0::22::INSTR'` with the actual address of your Keithley 6514 Power Meter. This address can be different depending on the interface you are using to connect to the power meter (e.g., GPIB, USB, Ethernet).

The script connects to the power meter, performs voltage, current, and power measurements, and then prints the results. Finally, it closes the connection to the power meter.
