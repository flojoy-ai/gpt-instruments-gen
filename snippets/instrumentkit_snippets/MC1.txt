Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a MC1 Positional Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import ik
from instrumentkit.contrib.qubitekk import MC1

# Connect to the MC1 Positional Controller
mc1 = MC1.open_serial('COM8', 19200, timeout=1)

# Set the position of the MC1
mc1.position = 10.0  # Set the position to 10.0 mm

# Get the current position of the MC1
position = mc1.position
print(f"Current position: {position} mm")

# Move the MC1 to a new position
new_position = 20.0  # New position to move to
mc1.move_to(new_position)

# Close the connection to the MC1
mc1.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'COM8'` with the correct serial port of your MC1 Positional Controller. You can also adjust the baud rate (`19200`) and timeout (`1`) according to your specific setup.

This script demonstrates how to connect to the MC1 Positional Controller, set and get the position, and move the MC1 to a new position. Finally, it closes the connection to the MC1.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed Instrumentkit and its dependencies. If not, you can install it using `pip install instrumentkit`.
