To connect to a MC1 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import qubitekk

# Connect to the MC1 Positional Controller
mc1 = qubitekk.MC1.open_serial('COM8', 19200, timeout=1)

# Now you can use the MC1 object to control the positional controller
# For example, you can move the controller to a specific position
mc1.move_to_position(100)

# You can also read the current position of the controller
position = mc1.get_position()
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'COM8'` with the correct serial port of your MC1 Positional Controller.
