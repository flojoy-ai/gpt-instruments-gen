Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a DPO4104 Oscilloscope:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = instrumentkit.connect('dpo4104', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Print the identification string of the oscilloscope
print(oscilloscope.identification)

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

In this script, we import the `instrumentkit` module and create a connection to the DPO4104 Oscilloscope using the `connect` function. The first argument to `connect` is the instrument type, which in this case is `'dpo4104'`. The second argument is the connection string, which specifies the communication protocol and address of the oscilloscope. In this example, we use the TCPIP protocol with the IP address `'192.168.1.1'`.

After establishing the connection, we can access various properties and methods of the oscilloscope. In this example, we print the identification string of the oscilloscope using the `identification` property.

Finally, we close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'192.168.1.1'` with the actual IP address of your oscilloscope.
