Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a Keithley 580 Power Meter:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 580 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley580.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to power
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.power

# Set the range to auto
power_meter.input_range = 'auto'

# Measure the power
power_measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the power measurement
print(f"Power: {power_measurement:.3f} {power_measurement.units}")
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Keithley 580 Power Meter. You can also adjust the measurement mode and range according to your needs.

Note that you'll need to have Instrumentkit installed in order to run this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
