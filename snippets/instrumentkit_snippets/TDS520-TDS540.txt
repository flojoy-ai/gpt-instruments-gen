Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TDS520/TDS540 Oscilloscope:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope = ik.tektronix.TDSSeries.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Set the timebase and voltage scale
scope.timebase = 1e-6  # 1 microsecond per division
scope.channel[1].voltage_scale = 0.1  # 0.1 volts per division

# Acquire a waveform
waveform = scope.acquire_waveform(channel=1)

# Plot the waveform
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(waveform.time, waveform.voltage)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Voltage (V)")
plt.show()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.close()
```

Make sure to replace `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` with the correct serial port of your oscilloscope, and `1` with the correct GPIB address of your oscilloscope.

This script connects to the oscilloscope, sets the timebase to 1 microsecond per division and the voltage scale of channel 1 to 0.1 volts per division. It then acquires a waveform from channel 1 and plots it using matplotlib. Finally, it disconnects from the oscilloscope.

Note that you'll need to have Instrumentkit and matplotlib installed in order to run this script. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit matplotlib
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
