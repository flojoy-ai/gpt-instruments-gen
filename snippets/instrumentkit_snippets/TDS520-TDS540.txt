To connect to a TDS520/TDS540 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the `tds5000.TDS5000` class. Here's an example Python script that connects to the oscilloscope and performs a simple measurement:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.tektronix.tds5000.TDS5000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Set the timebase and voltage scale
oscilloscope.timebase.scale = 1e-6  # 1 us/div
oscilloscope.channel[1].scale = 0.1  # 0.1 V/div

# Perform a measurement
measurement = oscilloscope.channel[1].measurements.rms()

# Print the measurement result
print(f"RMS Voltage: {measurement:.3f} V")

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

In this example, we first import the `instrumentkit` module and then create an instance of the `TDS5000` class using the `open_gpibusb` method. We pass the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the GPIB address (1) as arguments to the method.

Next, we set the timebase scale to 1 us/div and the voltage scale of channel 1 to 0.1 V/div using the `timebase.scale` and `channel.scale` properties, respectively.

We then perform a measurement of the RMS voltage on channel 1 using the `measurements.rms()` method of the channel object. The result is stored in the `measurement` variable.

Finally, we print the measurement result and close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close()` method.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
