To connect to a MDA8000HD Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, VISAInstrument

class MDA8000HD(Instrument):
    def __init__(self, visa_resource):
        super().__init__(visa_resource)
    
    def get_idn(self):
        return self.query('*IDN?')

# Connect to the MDA8000HD Oscilloscope
visa_resource = 'YOUR_VISA_RESOURCE'
mda8000hd = MDA8000HD(visa_resource)

# Get the instrument identification
idn = mda8000hd.get_idn()
print(f'Connected to: {idn}')
```

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_VISA_RESOURCE'` with the actual VISA resource address of your MDA8000HD Oscilloscope. You can find the VISA resource address in the instrument's documentation or by using a VISA resource manager tool.

This script defines a custom `MDA8000HD` class that inherits from `Instrument` and uses the `VISAInstrument` mixin provided by Instrumentkit. The `get_idn` method sends the `*IDN?` command to the instrument and returns the identification string.

To run this script, you need to have Instrumentkit installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Once installed, you can run the script and it will connect to the MDA8000HD Oscilloscope and print its identification string.
