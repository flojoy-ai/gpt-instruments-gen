Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a KIM101 Positional Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import KIM101

# Connect to the KIM101 Positional Controller
controller = KIM101()

# Set the position to 0
controller.position = 0

# Move the position to 10
controller.move_to(10)

# Get the current position
position = controller.position
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

Explanation of the code:
1. Import the `KIM101` class from the `instrumentkit` module.
2. Create an instance of the `KIM101` class, which represents the KIM101 Positional Controller.
3. Set the position of the controller to 0 using the `position` property.
4. Move the position to 10 using the `move_to()` method.
5. Get the current position using the `position` property and print it.
