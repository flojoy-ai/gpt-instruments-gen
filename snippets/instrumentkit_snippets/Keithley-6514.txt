To connect to a Keithley 6514 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the power meter
power_meter = ik.keithley.Keithley6514.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 12)

# Set the measurement mode to DC voltage
power_meter.mode = power_meter.Mode.voltage_dc

# Perform a measurement
measurement = power_meter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print(measurement)
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Keithley6514` class to connect to the power meter. It then sets the measurement mode to DC voltage using the `mode` property and performs a measurement using the `measure` method. Finally, it prints the measurement result.
