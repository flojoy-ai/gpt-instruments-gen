To connect to a Lakeshore 370 AC resistance bridge using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Lakeshore 370 AC resistance bridge
bridge = ik.lakeshore.Lakeshore370.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Get the resistance of the first channel
resistance = bridge.channel[0].resistance

# Print the resistance
print(resistance)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Lakeshore370` class to connect to the Lakeshore 370 AC resistance bridge. The `open_gpibusb` method takes the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the GPIB address (`1`) as arguments.

After connecting to the bridge, the script retrieves the resistance of the first channel using the `resistance` property of the `Channel` class. Finally, it prints the resistance value.
