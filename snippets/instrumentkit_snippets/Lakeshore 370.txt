To connect to a Lakeshore 370 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Lakeshore 370 Power Meter
power_meter = ik.lakeshore.Lakeshore370.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Read the power measurement
power = power_meter.power

# Print the power measurement
print(f"Power: {power:.2f} {power.units}")
```

Make sure to replace `'/dev/ttyUSB0'` with the correct serial port of your Lakeshore 370 Power Meter. The `1` parameter is the GPIB address of the instrument.

This script opens a connection to the Lakeshore 370 Power Meter and reads the power measurement using the `power` property. The power measurement is then printed to the console.
