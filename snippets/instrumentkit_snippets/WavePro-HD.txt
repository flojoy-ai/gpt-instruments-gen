To connect to a WavePro HD Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the `teledyne.WaveProHD` class. Here's an example script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
address = "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.WaveProHD.open_visa(address)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

# Set time per division to 20 ns
oscilloscope.time_div = 20 * ik.units.ns

# Access the first channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
channel.trace = True
channel.coupling = channel.Coupling.dc50
channel.scale = 1 * ik.units.V

# Read waveform from the channel
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope at the specified address, starts the trigger in automatic mode, sets the time per division to 20 ns, configures the first channel, reads a waveform from the channel, and finally disconnects from the oscilloscope.
