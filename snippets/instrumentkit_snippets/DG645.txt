To connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = ik.srs.SRSDG645.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Example usage
dg645.channel[dg645.Channels.A].delay = (dg645.channel[dg645.Channels.T0], 10 * ik.units.ns)
dg645.output[dg645.Outputs.AB].level_amplitude = 4.0 * ik.units.V
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and opens a connection to the DG645 Pulse Generator using the `open_gpibusb` method of the `SRSDG645` class. The first argument is the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the second argument is the GPIB address (`1`).

After connecting, you can use the `channel` property to access specific channels of the DG645 Pulse Generator. In the example, it sets the delay of channel A to 10 nanoseconds relative to channel T0.

Similarly, you can use the `output` property to access specific outputs of the DG645 Pulse Generator. In the example, it sets the amplitude of output AB to 4.0 volts.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
