To connect to a LPS710E/M Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the LPS710E/M Positional Controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.LPS710EM.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the channel object for channel 1
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled = True

# Move the channel to a specific position
channel.move(100)  # Move to position 100 (encoder counts)

# Get the current position of the channel
position = channel.position
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

This code connects to the LPS710E/M Positional Controller using the `open_serial` method, specifying the serial port and baud rate. It then retrieves the channel object for channel 1 and enables it. The channel is then moved to a specific position using the `move` method, and the current position is printed.
