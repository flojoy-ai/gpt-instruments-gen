To connect to a SRS 830 Lock-In Amplifier using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
srs = ik.srs.SRS830.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the lock-in frequency
srs.frequency = 1000 * ik.units.hertz

# Take a measurement with a sample rate of 1Hz and 10 samples
data = srs.take_measurement(1, 10)
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.srs.SRS830` class to connect to the lock-in amplifier. The first argument is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this example) and the second argument is the GPIB address of the lock-in amplifier.

Once connected, you can set the lock-in frequency using the `frequency` property. In this example, it is set to 1000 Hz.

Finally, you can use the `take_measurement` method to take a measurement with a specified sample rate and number of samples. In this example, it takes a measurement with a sample rate of 1 Hz and 10 samples, and the result is stored in the `data` variable.
