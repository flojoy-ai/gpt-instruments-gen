Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TDS5XX Oscilloscope:

```python
from instrumentkit import Scope

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope = Scope("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Set the timebase and voltage scale
scope.timebase = 1e-3  # 1 ms/div
scope.channel1.voltage_scale = 0.1  # 0.1 V/div

# Acquire a waveform
waveform = scope.acquire_waveform()

# Print the waveform data
print(waveform.data)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `Scope` class from the `instrumentkit` module. Then, we create an instance of the `Scope` class by passing the instrument's address as a string to the constructor.

Next, we set the timebase and voltage scale of the oscilloscope using the `timebase` and `voltage_scale` properties of the `Scope` and `Channel` classes, respectively.

We then acquire a waveform from the oscilloscope using the `acquire_waveform` method of the `Scope` class. This method returns a `Waveform` object that contains the waveform data.

Finally, we print the waveform data and disconnect from the oscilloscope using the `disconnect` method of the `Scope` class.

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your TDS5XX Oscilloscope.
