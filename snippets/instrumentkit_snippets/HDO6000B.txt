To connect to a HDO6000B Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
address = "TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR"
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa(address)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

# Close the connection
oscilloscope.close()
```

In this code, we first import the `instrumentkit` module as `ik`. Then, we specify the address of the oscilloscope we want to connect to. We use the `ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa()` method to open a VISA connection to the oscilloscope.

Once the connection is established, we can perform operations on the oscilloscope. In this example, we start the oscilloscope by calling `oscilloscope.run()` and then print the current trigger state using `oscilloscope.trigger_state`.

Finally, we close the connection to the oscilloscope by calling `oscilloscope.close()`.
