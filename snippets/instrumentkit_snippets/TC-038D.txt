Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TC-038D Temperature Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import hcp
from instrumentkit import units as u

# Connect to the TC-038D Temperature Controller
inst = hcp.TC038.open_serial('COM10')

# Set the setpoint temperature to 45.3°C
inst.setpoint = 45.3

# Read and print the current temperature
print(inst.temperature)
```

This script imports the `hcp` module from Instrumentkit, which provides support for the TC038 AC crystal oven by HC Photonics. It also imports the `units` module from Instrumentkit, which provides support for unit conversions.

The script then connects to the TC-038D Temperature Controller using the `open_serial` method of the `hcp.TC038` class. The argument `'COM10'` specifies the serial port to use for communication.

Next, the script sets the setpoint temperature of the oven to 45.3°C by assigning the desired temperature to the `setpoint` property of the `inst` object.

Finally, the script reads and prints the current temperature of the oven by accessing the `temperature` property of the `inst` object.

Note: The script assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library and its dependencies.
