Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TC-038D Temperature Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import hcp

# Connect to the TC-038D Temperature Controller
inst = hcp.TC038D.open_serial('COM10')

# Set the setpoint temperature to 45.3 degrees Celsius
inst.setpoint = 45.3

# Get the current temperature
temperature = inst.temperature

print(temperature)
```

Explanation:
1. The script imports the `hcp` module from `instrumentkit`, which provides support for the TC038 AC crystal oven by HC Photonics.
2. It then connects to the TC-038D Temperature Controller by calling the `open_serial` method of the `TC038D` class and passing the serial port name as an argument (e.g., `'COM10'`).
3. The script sets the setpoint temperature of the temperature controller to 45.3 degrees Celsius by assigning the desired value to the `setpoint` property of the `inst` object.
4. Finally, it retrieves the current temperature from the temperature controller by accessing the `temperature` property of the `inst` object and assigns it to the `temperature` variable.
5. The script then prints the value of the `temperature` variable, which represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
