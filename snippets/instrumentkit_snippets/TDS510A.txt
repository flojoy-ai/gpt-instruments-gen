To connect to a TDS510A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the TDS510A Oscilloscope
scope = ik.tektronix.TDS510A.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can query the instrument's identification
print(scope.identification)

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
scope.close()
```

In this script, we import the `instrumentkit` module as `ik`. Then, we use the `open_gpibusb` method of the `ik.tektronix.TDS510A` class to connect to the TDS510A Oscilloscope. The first argument is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this example) and the second argument is the GPIB address of the instrument.

After connecting, you can perform various operations on the oscilloscope. In the example, we query the instrument's identification using the `identification` property and print the result.

Finally, we close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method.
