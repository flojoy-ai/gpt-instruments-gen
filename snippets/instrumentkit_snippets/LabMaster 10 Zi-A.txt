To connect to a LabMaster 10 Zi-A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, VISAInstrument

class LabMasterOscilloscope(VISAInstrument):
    def __init__(self, resource_name):
        super().__init__(resource_name)
    
    def get_idn(self):
        return self.query('*IDN?')

# Connect to the LabMaster Oscilloscope
oscilloscope = LabMasterOscilloscope('your_resource_name')

# Get the instrument identification
idn = oscilloscope.get_idn()
print(f'Connected to: {idn}')

# Perform other operations with the oscilloscope
# ...

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_resource_name'` with the actual VISA resource name of your LabMaster 10 Zi-A Oscilloscope. You can find the resource name by using a VISA library such as PyVISA or NI-VISA.

This script creates a custom `LabMasterOscilloscope` class that inherits from `VISAInstrument` provided by Instrumentkit. The `get_idn` method is overridden to query the instrument identification using the `*IDN?` command.

You can then use the `LabMasterOscilloscope` class to connect to the oscilloscope, retrieve the instrument identification, and perform other operations as needed. Finally, the `close` method is called to disconnect from the oscilloscope.
