To connect to a LabMaster 10 Zi-A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.LabMaster10ZiA.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can read the waveform from a channel
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope using the `open_visa` method from the `ik.teledyne.LabMaster10ZiA` class. You need to provide the appropriate VISA address for your oscilloscope.

Once connected, you can perform various operations on the oscilloscope. In the example code, it reads the waveform from the first channel using the `read_waveform` method of the channel object.

Finally, you should close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method to release any resources.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pyvisa` and `numpy`, as mentioned in the documentation.
