To connect to a DPO70000 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the `DPO70000` class from the `instruments.tektronix.dpo70000` module. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to connect to the oscilloscope:

```python
from instruments.tektronix.dpo70000 import DPO70000

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = DPO70000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can query the instrument's identification
print(oscilloscope.query("*IDN?"))

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

In this example, the `open_gpibusb` method is used to establish a connection to the oscilloscope. The first argument `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` is the device file for the GPIB-USB adapter, and the second argument `1` is the GPIB address of the oscilloscope.

After connecting, you can perform various operations on the oscilloscope using the `oscilloscope` object. For example, you can use the `query` method to send SCPI commands and retrieve the instrument's identification.

Finally, don't forget to close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method to release any resources and terminate the connection.
