To connect to a DPO70000 oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
tek = ik.tektronix.TekDPO70000.open_tcpip("192.168.0.2", 8888)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, read waveform from channel 0
[x, y] = tek.channel[0].read_waveform()

# Close the connection
tek.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at IP address "192.168.0.2" and port 8888 using the `open_tcpip` method of the `TekDPO70000` class. It then reads a waveform from channel 0 using the `read_waveform` method of the `Channel` class. Finally, it closes the connection using the `close` method.
