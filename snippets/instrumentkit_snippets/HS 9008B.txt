To connect to a HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer
hs = ik.holzworth.HS9000.open_tcpip("192.168.0.2", 8080)

# Access the channels and retrieve their frequency
for channel in hs.channel:
    print(channel.frequency)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and then uses the `open_tcpip` method of the `HS9000` class to connect to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer at the specified IP address and port number.

After connecting, you can access the channels of the synthesizer using the `channel` property of the `HS9000` object. In the example script, it loops over all the channels and prints their frequencies.

Note: Make sure to replace `"192.168.0.2"` with the actual IP address of your HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer and `"8080"` with the appropriate port number.
