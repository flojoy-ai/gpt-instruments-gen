To connect to a CTC100 Temperature Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import CTC100

# Create an instance of the CTC100 Temperature Controller
ctc = CTC100()

# Connect to the CTC100 Temperature Controller
ctc.connect()

# Perform temperature control operations here

# Disconnect from the CTC100 Temperature Controller
ctc.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `CTC100` class from the `instrumentkit` module and connects to the temperature controller using the `connect()` method. You can then perform temperature control operations using the `ctc` object. Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to disconnect from the temperature controller.

Please note that you may need to install the `instrumentkit` module before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Make sure to consult the documentation for the `instrumentkit` module and the specific CTC100 Temperature Controller for more details on how to use the available methods and perform temperature control operations.
