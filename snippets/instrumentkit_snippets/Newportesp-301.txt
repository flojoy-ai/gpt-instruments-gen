To connect to a Newport ESP-301 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
from instrumentkit import NewportESP301

# Connect to the controller
controller = NewportESP301.open_serial("COM3")

# Move the axis to a specific position
controller.axis[0].move(0.001, absolute=False)

# Close the connection
controller.close()
```

In this code, we first import the `NewportESP301` class from the `instrumentkit` module. Then, we use the `open_serial` method to connect to the controller using the specified serial port (in this case, "COM3").

Next, we can use the `controller.axis` property to access the individual axes of the controller. In this example, we move the first axis (`controller.axis[0]`) by 0.001 units relative to its current position.

Finally, we close the connection to the controller using the `close` method.

Note: Make sure to replace "COM3" with the correct serial port for your setup.
