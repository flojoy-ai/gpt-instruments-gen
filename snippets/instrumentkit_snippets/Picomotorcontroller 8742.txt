To connect to a Picomotorcontroller 8742 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Define the IP address and port of the controller
ip = "192.168.1.2"
port = 23

# Open a TCP/IP connection to the controller
controller = ik.newport.PicoMotorController8742.open_tcpip(ip, port)

# Set the controller address (if using multiple controllers)
controller.controller_address = 1

# Get the first axis of the controller
axis = controller.axis[0]

# Move the motor relative to its current position
axis.move_relative = 100

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.close()
```

This code establishes a TCP/IP connection to the Picomotorcontroller 8742 at the specified IP address and port. It then sets the controller address (if using multiple controllers) and gets the first axis of the controller. Finally, it moves the motor relative to its current position by 100 steps and closes the connection to the controller.
