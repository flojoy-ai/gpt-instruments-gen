To connect to a KEYSIGHT 33220A RF Signal Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the RF Signal Generator
signal_generator = instrumentkit.connect('KEYSIGHT 33220A')

# Perform operations on the RF Signal Generator
# For example, set the frequency and amplitude
signal_generator.set_frequency(1000)  # Set frequency to 1 kHz
signal_generator.set_amplitude(0.5)  # Set amplitude to 0.5 V

# Close the connection to the RF Signal Generator
signal_generator.close()
```

Make sure you have Instrumentkit installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumentkit
```

Replace `'KEYSIGHT 33220A'` with the appropriate connection string for your specific instrument.
