Unfortunately, the given documentation is not sufficient to provide a complete solution. The documentation snippet provided, ```nan```, does not provide any information about the SC10 instrument or how to connect to it using Instrumentkit.

To provide a solution, we would need more detailed documentation or specifications for the SC10 instrument, including the communication protocol, connection method (e.g., USB, Ethernet), and any required drivers or libraries.

Once we have the necessary information, we can use Instrumentkit to connect to the SC10 instrument and perform various operations. Here's a general outline of how the code might look:

```python
import instrumentkit

# Create a connection to the SC10 instrument
connection = instrumentkit.Connection(<connection_parameters>)

# Create an instance of the SC10 instrument
sc10 = instrumentkit.SC10(connection)

# Perform operations on the SC10 instrument
sc10.set_parameter(<parameter_name>, <value>)
result = sc10.get_measurement(<measurement_type>)

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

Replace `<connection_parameters>` with the appropriate parameters for connecting to the SC10 instrument, such as the communication interface (e.g., USB, Ethernet) and any required addresses or settings.

Replace `<parameter_name>` and `<value>` with the specific parameter you want to set on the SC10 instrument, such as the voltage or frequency.

Replace `<measurement_type>` with the specific measurement you want to retrieve from the SC10 instrument, such as the current or power.

Note that the actual code will depend on the specific implementation details of the SC10 instrument and the Instrumentkit library.
