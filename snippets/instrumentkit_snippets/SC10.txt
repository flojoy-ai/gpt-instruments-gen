Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a SC10 Shutter Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import SC10

# Connect to the SC10 Shutter Controller
shutter_controller = SC10("COM1")

# Open the shutter
shutter_controller.open_shutter()

# Close the shutter
shutter_controller.close_shutter()

# Check if the shutter is open
is_open = shutter_controller.is_shutter_open()

# Check if the shutter is closed
is_closed = shutter_controller.is_shutter_closed()

# Disconnect from the shutter controller
shutter_controller.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace "COM1" with the appropriate serial port or connection method for your SC10 Shutter Controller.
