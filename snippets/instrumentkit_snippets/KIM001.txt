To connect to a KIM001 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install the Instrumentkit library by running `pip install instrumentkit` in your terminal.

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from instrumentkit import KIM001
from instrumentkit import ConnectionError
```

3. Create an instance of the KIM001 controller:

```python
controller = KIM001()
```

4. Connect to the controller:

```python
try:
    controller.connect()
    print("Connected to KIM001 Positional Controller")
except ConnectionError:
    print("Failed to connect to KIM001 Positional Controller")
```

5. You can now use the controller to send commands and receive data. For example, to move the controller to a specific position:

```python
position = 100  # desired position in millimeters
controller.move_to(position)
```

6. Finally, don't forget to disconnect from the controller when you're done:

```python
controller.disconnect()
```

Here's the complete script:

```python
from instrumentkit import KIM001
from instrumentkit import ConnectionError

controller = KIM001()

try:
    controller.connect()
    print("Connected to KIM001 Positional Controller")

    position = 100  # desired position in millimeters
    controller.move_to(position)

except ConnectionError:
    print("Failed to connect to KIM001 Positional Controller")

finally:
    controller.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `position = 100` with the desired position value in millimeters.
