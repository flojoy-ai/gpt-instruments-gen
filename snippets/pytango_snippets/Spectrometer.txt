```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Spectrometer device
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Read a scalar attribute from the device
attribute_value = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Write a value to a scalar attribute of the device
device_proxy.write_attribute("attribute_name", attribute_value)

# Call a command on the device
device_proxy.command_inout("command_name", command_argument)
```

In the code above, replace "device_name" with the actual name of the Spectrometer device you want to connect to. Replace "attribute_name" with the name of the attribute you want to read or write, and replace "command_name" with the name of the command you want to call. Replace "command_argument" with the argument value for the command, if any.
