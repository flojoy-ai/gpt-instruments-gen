```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy for the Keithley 2182A Power Meter
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device/hostname/family/member")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.connect()

# Read the power measurement
power_measurement = device_proxy.read_attribute("power").value

# Print the power measurement
print(power_measurement)

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `PyTango` module.
2. Create a `DeviceProxy` object for the Keithley 2182A Power Meter by providing the device's Tango address in the format `"device/hostname/family/member"`.
3. Connect to the device using the `connect()` method of the `DeviceProxy` object.
4. Read the power measurement attribute using the `read_attribute()` method of the `DeviceProxy` object, passing the attribute name as a string.
5. Access the value of the power measurement using the `value` attribute of the returned attribute object.
6. Print the power measurement value.
7. Disconnect from the device using the `disconnect()` method of the `DeviceProxy` object.
