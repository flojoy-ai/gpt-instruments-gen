```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Keithley multimeter
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Read a value from the multimeter
value = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Print the value
print(value)
```

In the code above, replace "device_name" with the actual name of the Keithley multimeter device you want to connect to, and replace "attribute_name" with the name of the attribute you want to read from the device.
