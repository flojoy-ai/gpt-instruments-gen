```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Picoscalectrl device
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Read a scalar attribute from the device
attribute_value = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Write a value to a scalar attribute of the device
device_proxy.write_attribute("attribute_name", attribute_value)

# Call a command on the device
device_proxy.command_inout("command_name")
```

In the code above, replace "device_name" with the actual name of the Picoscalectrl device you want to connect to. Similarly, replace "attribute_name" and "command_name" with the names of the specific attributes and commands you want to interact with on the device.
