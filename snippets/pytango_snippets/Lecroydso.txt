To connect to a LeCroy Oscilloscope using Pytango, you can use the following code:

```python
import PyTango
from lecroydso import DSOConnection
from lecroydso import LeCroyDSO

# Create a connection to the oscilloscope
connection = DSOConnection("your_oscilloscope_address")

# Connect to the oscilloscope
connection.connect()

# Create an instance of the LeCroyDSO class
lecroy_dso = LeCroyDSO(connection)

# Now you can use the LeCroyDSO instance to interact with the oscilloscope
# For example, you can get the serial number of the oscilloscope
serial_number = lecroy_dso.get_serial_number()
print("Serial Number:", serial_number)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
connection.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"your_oscilloscope_address"` with the actual address of your oscilloscope.
