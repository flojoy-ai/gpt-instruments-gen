```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Keithley 6485 ML device
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device/hostname/Keithley6485ML/1")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.connect()

# Perform operations on the device
# ...

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `PyTango` module.
2. Create a `DeviceProxy` object by providing the device's Tango address (`device/hostname/Keithley6485ML/1`).
3. Connect to the device using the `connect()` method of the `DeviceProxy` object.
4. Perform any desired operations on the device.
5. Disconnect from the device using the `disconnect()` method of the `DeviceProxy` object.
