```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the FF-C1X Mass Controller
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Read a property value from the device
property_value = device_proxy.read_attribute("property_name").value

# Write a value to a writable property of the device
device_proxy.write_attribute("property_name", value)

# Call a command on the device
device_proxy.command_inout("command_name", command_input)
```

Replace "device_name" with the actual name of the FF-C1X Mass Controller device. Replace "property_name" with the name of the property you want to read or write. Replace "value" with the value you want to write to a writable property. Replace "command_name" with the name of the command you want to call. Replace "command_input" with the input parameter for the command, if any.
