Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pytango to connect to a Keithley 6487 Power Meter:

```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy for the Keithley 6487 Power Meter
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device/proxy/name")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.connect()

# Read the measurement value from the power meter
measurement = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Print the measurement value
print(measurement)

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.disconnect()
```

In the code above, you need to replace `"device/proxy/name"` with the actual name of the device proxy for the Keithley 6487 Power Meter. Similarly, replace `"attribute_name"` with the name of the attribute you want to read from the power meter.

Make sure you have PyTango installed in your Python environment before running this script.
