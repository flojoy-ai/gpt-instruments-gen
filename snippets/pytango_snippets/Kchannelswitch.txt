Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pytango to connect to a Kchannelswitch device:

```python
import PyTango

# Define the device name and connection details
device_name = "kchannelswitch/device/1"
host = "localhost"
port = 10000

# Create a Tango device proxy
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy(f"{device_name}:{host}:{port}")

# Check if the device is online
if device_proxy.ping():
    print(f"Device {device_name} is online.")
else:
    print(f"Device {device_name} is offline.")

# Get the current state of the device
state = device_proxy.state()
print(f"Device {device_name} is in state: {state}")

# Switch to channel 2
device_proxy.command_inout("SwitchChannel", 2)

# Get the current channel
current_channel = device_proxy.read_attribute("CurrentChannel").value
print(f"Current channel: {current_channel}")
```

In this example, we first import the `PyTango` module. Then, we define the device name, host, and port for the Kchannelswitch device.

Next, we create a `DeviceProxy` object by passing the device name and connection details. This object allows us to interact with the device.

We use the `ping()` method to check if the device is online. If it is, we print a message indicating that the device is online. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the device is offline.

We use the `state()` method to get the current state of the device and print it.

We then use the `command_inout()` method to switch to channel 2.

Finally, we use the `read_attribute()` method to read the value of the `CurrentChannel` attribute and print it.

Note: Make sure to replace `"kchannelswitch/device/1"`, `"localhost"`, and `10000` with the actual device name, host, and port of your Kchannelswitch device.
