Here's an example of a Python script that uses Pytango to connect to an Acquirewaveformlecroy device:

```python
import PyTango as pt

# Define the device name
device_name = "sys/tg_test/1"

# Create a Tango device proxy
device_proxy = pt.DeviceProxy(device_name)

# Check if the device is online
if device_proxy.ping():
    print("Device is online")
else:
    print("Device is offline")

# Read the waveform attribute
waveform = device_proxy.read_attribute("waveform").value

# Print the waveform data
print(waveform)
```

In this example, we first import the `PyTango` module. Then, we define the device name as a string. Next, we create a Tango device proxy using the `DeviceProxy` class and pass in the device name.

We can use the `ping()` method of the device proxy to check if the device is online. If the device is online, we print "Device is online". Otherwise, we print "Device is offline".

To read the waveform attribute, we use the `read_attribute()` method of the device proxy and pass in the attribute name as a string. In this case, the attribute name is "waveform". The `read_attribute()` method returns a `TangoAttribute` object, and we can access the value of the attribute using the `value` attribute of the `TangoAttribute` object.

Finally, we print the waveform data.
