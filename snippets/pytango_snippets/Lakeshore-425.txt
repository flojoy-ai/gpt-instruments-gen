To connect to a Lake Shore Model 425 Gaussmeter using Pytango, you can use the following code:

```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy for the Lake Shore Model 425 Gaussmeter
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.Connect()

# Check if the device is connected
if device_proxy.State() == PyTango.DevState.ON:
    print("Device is connected.")
else:
    print("Device is not connected.")

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.Disconnect()
```

Replace `"device_name"` with the actual name of the device in your Tango database.
