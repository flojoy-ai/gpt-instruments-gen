```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Keithleyvdc device
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device/hostname/Keithleyvdc/1")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.connect()

# Perform operations on the device
# ...

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.disconnect()
```

In this code, we import the `PyTango` module and create a `DeviceProxy` object to connect to the Keithleyvdc device. We specify the device's hostname and name (`Keithleyvdc`) along with the instance number (`1`) in the `DeviceProxy` constructor.

We then call the `connect()` method on the `DeviceProxy` object to establish a connection to the device. After that, you can perform various operations on the device using the `DeviceProxy` object.

Finally, we call the `disconnect()` method to disconnect from the device.
