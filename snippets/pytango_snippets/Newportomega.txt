```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy object to connect to the Newportomega device
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Read a device attribute
attribute_value = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Write a device attribute
device_proxy.write_attribute("attribute_name", attribute_value)

# Call a device command
device_proxy.command_inout("command_name")
```

In the code above, replace "device_name" with the actual name of the Newportomega device you want to connect to. Replace "attribute_name" with the name of the attribute you want to read or write, and replace "command_name" with the name of the command you want to call.
