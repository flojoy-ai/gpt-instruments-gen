```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy for the Keithley 6485 Power Meter
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device_name")

# Connect to the device
device_proxy.connect()

# Read the power measurement
power_measurement = device_proxy.read_attribute("attribute_name").value

# Print the power measurement
print(power_measurement)

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy.disconnect()
```

In the code above, replace "device_name" with the actual name of the Keithley 6485 Power Meter device in your Tango database. Replace "attribute_name" with the name of the attribute you want to read from the device, such as "Power" or "Voltage".
