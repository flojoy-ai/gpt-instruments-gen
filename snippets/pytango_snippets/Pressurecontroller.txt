Here is an example Python script that uses Pytango to connect to a Pressurecontroller:

```python
import PyTango

# Define the device name
device_name = "domain/family/member"

# Create a PyTango DeviceProxy object
device_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy(device_name)

# Check if the device is online
if device_proxy.state() == PyTango.DevState.ON:
    print("Device is online")
else:
    print("Device is offline")

# Read the pressure value
pressure = device_proxy.read_attribute("pressure").value
print("Pressure: {} mbar".format(pressure))

# Set the pressure value
new_pressure = 100.0  # Set the desired pressure value in mbar
device_proxy.write_attribute("pressure", new_pressure)

# Check if the pressure value was set successfully
if device_proxy.read_attribute("pressure").value == new_pressure:
    print("Pressure set successfully")
else:
    print("Failed to set pressure")

# Disconnect from the device
device_proxy = None
```

Please note that you need to replace `"domain/family/member"` with the actual device name of your Pressurecontroller.
