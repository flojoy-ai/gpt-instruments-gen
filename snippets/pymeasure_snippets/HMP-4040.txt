Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a HMP 4040 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import HMP4040

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the HMP4040 Power Supply
power_supply = HMP4040(adapter)

# Perform operations on the power supply
power_supply.beep()  # Emit a single beep from the instrument

power_supply.control_method = "REM"  # Set the control method to remote

voltage = power_supply.voltage  # Get the output voltage
print("Output Voltage:", voltage)

current = power_supply.current  # Get the output current
print("Output Current:", current)

power_supply.voltage = 5.0  # Set the output voltage to 5.0 V
power_supply.current = 1.0  # Set the output current to 1.0 A

power_supply.output_enabled = True  # Enable the output

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the HMP4040 Power Supply using a VISA adapter and performs various operations such as emitting a beep, setting the control method to remote, getting and setting the output voltage and current, enabling the output, and finally disconnecting from the power supply.
