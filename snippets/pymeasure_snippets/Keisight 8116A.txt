Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 8116A Function Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.hp import HP8116A

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::9::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = HP8116A(adapter)

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
instrument.frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude to 1 V
instrument.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
instrument.output_enabled = True

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the instrument using a VISA adapter, sets the frequency to 1 kHz, sets the amplitude to 1 V, enables the output, and then disconnects from the instrument.
