Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an IPS 120-10 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import OxfordInstrumentsIPS120_10

# Connect to the IPS 120-10 Power Supply
ips = OxfordInstrumentsIPS120_10("GPIB::25")

# Enable control of the power supply
ips.enable_control()

# Train the magnet after it has been cooled-down
training_scheme = [
    (11.8, 1.0),
    (13.9, 0.4),
    (14.9, 0.2),
    (16.0, 0.1),
]
ips.train_magnet(training_scheme)

# Set the magnetic field to 12 Tesla
ips.set_field(12)

# Print the current field
print(ips.field)

# Set the magnetic field to 0 Tesla
ips.set_field(0)

# Disable control of the power supply
ips.disable_control()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB::25"` with the appropriate address of your IPS 120-10 Power Supply.
