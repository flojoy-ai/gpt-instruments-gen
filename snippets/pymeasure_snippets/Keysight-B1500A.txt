Here is an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight B1500A Spectrum Analyzer:

```python
from pymeasure import Instrument

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = Instrument("GPIB::1::INSTR")

# Set the measurement mode to spectrum analyzer
instrument.write("MODE SA")

# Set the center frequency to 1 GHz
instrument.write("FREQ:CENT 1e9")

# Set the span to 1 MHz
instrument.write("FREQ:SPAN 1e6")

# Set the resolution bandwidth to 1 kHz
instrument.write("BAND:RES 1e3")

# Set the video bandwidth to 1 kHz
instrument.write("BAND:VID 1e3")

# Set the reference level to 0 dBm
instrument.write("DISP:TRAC:Y:RLEV 0")

# Start the measurement
instrument.write("INIT")

# Wait for the measurement to complete
instrument.wait_for_srq()

# Read the measurement data
data = instrument.ask("TRACE:DATA?")

# Print the measurement data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the instrument using the GPIB interface and sets up the measurement mode, center frequency, span, resolution bandwidth, video bandwidth, and reference level. It then starts the measurement, waits for it to complete, and reads the measurement data. Finally, it prints the measurement data and disconnects from the instrument.
