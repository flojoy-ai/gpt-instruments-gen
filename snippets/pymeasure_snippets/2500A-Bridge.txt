Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a 2500A Bridge Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import AH2500A

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the 2500A Bridge Multimeter
multimeter = AH2500A(adapter)

# Perform a single capacitance and loss measurement
capacitance, loss, voltage = multimeter.caplossvolt

# Print the measurement results
print(f"Capacitance: {capacitance} pF")
print(f"Loss: {loss} nS")
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. Create a VISA adapter using the appropriate address for your instrument.
3. Create an instance of the AH2500A class, passing the adapter as an argument.
4. Use the `caplossvolt` property of the multimeter object to perform a single capacitance and loss measurement. This property returns a tuple containing the capacitance, loss, and voltage values.
5. Print the measurement results.
6. Disconnect from the multimeter using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB0::1::INSTR"` with the correct address for your instrument.
