Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a 2500A Bridge Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import AH2500A

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the AH2500A instrument
multimeter = AH2500A(adapter)

# Perform a single capacitance and loss measurement
capacitance, loss, voltage = multimeter.caplossvolt

# Print the measurement values
print(f"Capacitance: {capacitance} pF")
print(f"Loss: {loss} nS")
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")

# Disconnect from the instrument
multimeter.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. We import the necessary modules from Pymeasure: `VISAAdapter` for communication and `AH2500A` for the 2500A Bridge Multimeter instrument.
2. We create a `VISAAdapter` object, specifying the appropriate address for the instrument. In this example, we assume the instrument is connected via GPIB at address 1.
3. We create an `AH2500A` object, passing the adapter as an argument to establish the connection.
4. We use the `caplossvolt` measurement property of the `AH2500A` object to perform a single capacitance and loss measurement. This property returns a tuple of capacitance, loss, and voltage values.
5. We print the measurement values using f-strings.
6. We disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method of the `AH2500A` object.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure`, `pyvisa`, and the appropriate VISA library for your instrument.
