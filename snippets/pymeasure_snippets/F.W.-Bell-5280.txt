Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a F.W. Bell 5080 Handheld Gaussmeter:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import SerialInstrument
from pymeasure.adapters import SerialAdapter

# Create a SerialAdapter for the instrument
adapter = SerialAdapter(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=2400, timeout=500)

# Create a SerialInstrument object for the F.W. Bell 5080 Handheld Gaussmeter
meter = SerialInstrument(adapter, name="F.W. Bell 5080 Handheld Gaussmeter")

# Connect to the instrument
meter.open()

# Set the measurement units to Gauss
meter.units = 'gauss'

# Set the range to 1 (3 kG)
meter.range = 1

# Read and print a field measurement in G
print(meter.field)

# Sample 100 field measurements
fields = meter.fields(100)

# Print the mean and standard deviation of the samples
print(fields.mean(), fields.std())

# Close the connection to the instrument
meter.close()
```

This script connects to the F.W. Bell 5080 Handheld Gaussmeter using a SerialAdapter and creates a SerialInstrument object for it. It then sets the measurement units to Gauss and the range to 1 (3 kG). It reads and prints a field measurement in G, samples 100 field measurements, and prints the mean and standard deviation of the samples. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
