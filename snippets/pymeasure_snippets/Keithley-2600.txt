Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2600 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2600

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the Keithley 2600 Power Supply
keithley = Keithley2600(adapter)

# Set the source mode to voltage and apply a voltage of 5V
keithley.ChA.source_mode = 'voltage'
keithley.ChA.source_voltage = 5.0

# Enable the output
keithley.ChA.source_output = 'ON'

# Measure the voltage and current
voltage = keithley.ChA.voltage
current = keithley.ChA.current

# Print the measured values
print("Voltage: %.3f V" % voltage)
print("Current: %.3f A" % current)

# Disable the output and close the connection
keithley.ChA.source_output = 'OFF'
# Disconnect from the Keithley 2600 Power Supply
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script connects to a Keithley 2600 Power Supply using a VISA adapter. It sets the source mode to voltage and applies a voltage of 5V to channel A. Then, it enables the output and measures the voltage and current. Finally, it disables the output and closes the connection.
