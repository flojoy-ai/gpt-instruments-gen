Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SFM RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.rohde_schwarz import SFM
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SFM RF Signal Generator
signal_generator = SFM(adapter)

# Set the frequency to 100 MHz
signal_generator.frequency = 100E6

# Set the output level to -10 dBm
signal_generator.level = -10

# Enable the RF output
signal_generator.rf_out_enabled = True

# Disconnect from the SFM RF Signal Generator
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the SFM RF Signal Generator using a VISA adapter and sets the frequency to 100 MHz and the output level to -10 dBm. It then enables the RF output and disconnects from the signal generator.
