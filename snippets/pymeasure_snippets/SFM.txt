To connect to a SFM RF Signal Generator using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.rf import SFM

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SFM RF Signal Generator
signal_generator = SFM(adapter)

# Perform operations on the signal generator
signal_generator.frequency = 100E6  # Set the frequency to 100 MHz
signal_generator.level = -10  # Set the output level to -10 dBm

# Disconnect from the signal generator
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

This script creates a `VISAAdapter` object to establish a connection with the SFM RF Signal Generator using the GPIB interface. Then, it creates an `SFM` object with the adapter to interact with the instrument.

You can perform various operations on the `signal_generator` object, such as setting the frequency and output level. Finally, you can disconnect from the signal generator using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace the GPIB address (`GPIB0::1::INSTR`) with the correct address of your SFM RF Signal Generator.
