Sure! Here's an example script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a 2700A Bridge Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure import instruments

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter = instruments.K2700A("GPIB::1::INSTR")

# Set the measurement mode to resistance
multimeter.mode = "resistance"

# Perform a measurement
measurement = multimeter.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print("Resistance: {} Ohms".format(measurement))

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `K2700A` class from the `pymeasure.instruments` module. We then create an instance of the `K2700A` class, passing the GPIB address of the multimeter as an argument.

We can then use various methods and properties of the `K2700A` object to interact with the multimeter. In this example, we set the measurement mode to resistance using the `mode` property, and then perform a measurement using the `measure` method.

Finally, we print the measurement result and disconnect from the multimeter using the `disconnect` method.

Note that you may need to adjust the GPIB address in the `K2700A` constructor to match the address of your specific multimeter.
