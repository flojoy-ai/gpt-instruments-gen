Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2700 Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2700

# Connect to the Keithley 2700
keithley = Keithley2700("GPIB::1")

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument
# For example, you can read the state of the channels
state = keithley.get_state_of_channels([101, 102, 103])
print("State of channels 101, 102, 103:", state)

# Close specific channels
keithley.closed_channels = [101, 102, 103]

# Open all channels
keithley.open_all_channels()

# Close rows to columns on the 7709 connection matrix
keithley.close_rows_to_columns([1, 2], [1, 2])

# Open rows to columns on the 7709 connection matrix
keithley.open_rows_to_columns([1, 2], [1, 2])

# Perform system operations
keithley.beep(1000, 1)
keithley.triad(1000, 1)
keithley.reset()

# Display closed channels on the instrument's display
keithley.display_closed_channels()

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 2700 using the GPIB address "GPIB::1". It then performs some operations with the instrument, such as getting the state of channels 1 and 2, closing all channels, and finally disconnecting from the instrument.

Note that you may need to install the `pymeasure` package before running this script. You can install it using `pip install pymeasure`.
