To connect to a Keithley 2000 Multimeter using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2000

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Keithley 2000 Multimeter
meter = Keithley2000(adapter)

# Perform measurements or configure the instrument as needed
meter.measure_voltage()
print("Voltage:", meter.voltage)

meter.measure_current()
print("Current:", meter.current)

meter.measure_resistance()
print("Resistance:", meter.resistance)

# Disconnect from the instrument
meter.disconnect()
```

This script creates a `VISAAdapter` object to connect to the instrument using the GPIB address "GPIB::1". Then, a `Keithley2000` object is created using the adapter. You can perform measurements or configure the instrument as needed using the provided methods and properties. Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to disconnect from the instrument.
