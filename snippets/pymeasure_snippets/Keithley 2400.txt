Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2400 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2400

# Connect to the Keithley 2400
keithley = Keithley2400("GPIB::1")

# Configure the measurement settings
keithley.measure_voltage()
keithley.voltage_range = 10
keithley.voltage_nplc = 1

# Enable the source and set the voltage
keithley.enable_source()
keithley.source_voltage = 5

# Perform a measurement
voltage = keithley.voltage
print("Measured voltage:", voltage)

# Disable the source and disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disable_source()
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script connects to a Keithley 2400 Power Supply using the GPIB interface (replace "GPIB::1" with the appropriate address for your setup). It configures the instrument to measure voltage, sets the voltage range and integration time, enables the source, sets the desired voltage, performs a measurement, and then disables the source and disconnects from the instrument.

Note: Make sure you have the `pymeasure` package installed before running this script.
