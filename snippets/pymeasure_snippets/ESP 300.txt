Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ESP 300 Positional Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.newport import ESP300

# Connect to the ESP 300 controller
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
controller = ESP300(adapter)

# Enable the axes
controller.enable()

# Move the x-axis to a specific position
controller.x.position = 10

# Move the y-axis to a specific position
controller.y.position = 20

# Move the phi-axis to a specific position
controller.phi.position = 30

# Wait for the motion to complete
controller.x.wait_for_stop()
controller.y.wait_for_stop()
controller.phi.wait_for_stop()

# Disable the axes
controller.disable()

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the ESP 300 controller using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `ESP300` class. It then enables the axes, sets the positions of the x, y, and phi axes, waits for the motion to complete, disables the axes, and finally shuts down the controller.

Note: You will need to install the `pymeasure` package and have the appropriate VISA drivers installed to run this script.
