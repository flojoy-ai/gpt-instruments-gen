Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 6517B Power Meter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley6517B

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Keithley 6517B Power Meter
keithley = Keithley6517B(adapter)

# Enable the source output
keithley.enable_source()

# Set up to measure resistance
keithley.measure_resistance()

# Set the source voltage range to 200 V
keithley.source_voltage_range = 200

# Set the source voltage to 20 V
keithley.source_voltage = 20

# Ramp the voltage to 50 V
keithley.ramp_to_voltage(50)

# Print the measured resistance in Ohms
print(keithley.resistance)

# Ramp the voltage to 0 V and disable the output
keithley.shutdown()

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script first creates a VISA adapter using the GPIB address of the Keithley 6517B Power Meter. Then, it creates an instance of the `Keithley6517B` class using the adapter. The script enables the source output, sets up the instrument to measure resistance, and sets the source voltage range and voltage. It then ramps the voltage to 50 V and prints the measured resistance. Finally, it ramps the voltage to 0 V and disables the output before disconnecting from the instrument.
