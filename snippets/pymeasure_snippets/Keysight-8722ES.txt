Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 8722ES Network Analyzer:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import visa
from pymeasure.instruments.agilent import Agilent8722ES

# Connect to the instrument
resource_manager = visa.ResourceManager()
instrument = Agilent8722ES(resource_manager.open_resource('GPIB0::1::INSTR'))

# Set the start and stop frequencies
instrument.start_frequency = 1e6  # 1 MHz
instrument.stop_frequency = 1e9  # 1 GHz

# Set the number of scan points
instrument.scan_points = 101

# Perform a single scan
instrument.scan_single()

# Get the frequencies and data from the scan
frequencies = instrument.frequencies
data_magnitude = instrument.data_magnitude
data_phase = instrument.data_phase

# Print the frequencies and data
for frequency, magnitude, phase in zip(frequencies, data_magnitude, data_phase):
    print(f"Frequency: {frequency} Hz, Magnitude: {magnitude} dB, Phase: {phase} degrees")

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the instrument using the VISA library, sets the start and stop frequencies, and performs a single scan. It then retrieves the frequencies, magnitude, and phase data from the scan and prints them out. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.

Note: Make sure to install the necessary dependencies (`pymeasure`, `pyvisa`, and `numpy`) before running the script.
