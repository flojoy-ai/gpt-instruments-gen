Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Fluke 3000 FC Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.fluke import Fluke3000FC

# Connect to the Fluke 3000 FC Multimeter
multimeter = Fluke3000FC("COM1")  # Replace "COM1" with the actual port name

# Initialize the multimeter
multimeter.initialize()

# Read the voltage measurement
voltage = multimeter.voltage_dc

# Print the measurement
print("Voltage: {} V".format(voltage))

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"COM1"` with the actual port name where your Fluke 3000 FC Multimeter is connected.
