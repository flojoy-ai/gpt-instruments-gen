Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Buffer:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Buffer

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter()

# Connect to the Buffer instrument
buffer = Buffer(adapter, "GPIB::1::INSTR")

# Read data from the Buffer
data = buffer.read()

# Print the data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the Buffer
buffer.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules from Pymeasure. We create a `VISAAdapter` object to handle communication with the instrument. Then, we create a `Buffer` object by passing the adapter and the instrument address (e.g., "GPIB::1::INSTR") to the constructor.

We can then use the `read()` method of the `Buffer` object to read data from the instrument. The data is stored in the `data` variable.

Finally, we print the data and disconnect from the Buffer instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary VISA drivers installed and the correct instrument address specified in the script.
