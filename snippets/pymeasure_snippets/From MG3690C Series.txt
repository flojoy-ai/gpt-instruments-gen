Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a From MG3690C Series RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure import instruments

# Connect to the RF Signal Generator
generator = instruments.FromMG3690C("GPIB::1")

# Set the frequency to 1 GHz
generator.frequency = 1e9

# Set the power level to -10 dBm
generator.power_level = -10

# Enable the output
generator.output = True

# Disconnect from the RF Signal Generator
generator.disconnect()
```

This script first imports the `FromMG3690C` class from the `pymeasure.instruments` module. It then creates an instance of the `FromMG3690C` class, specifying the GPIB address of the RF Signal Generator.

The script then sets the frequency to 1 GHz using the `frequency` property of the `FromMG3690C` class. Similarly, it sets the power level to -10 dBm using the `power_level` property.

Next, the script enables the output of the RF Signal Generator by setting the `output` property to `True`.

Finally, the script disconnects from the RF Signal Generator using the `disconnect()` method of the `FromMG3690C` class.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary drivers and libraries installed for your RF Signal Generator and GPIB interface.
