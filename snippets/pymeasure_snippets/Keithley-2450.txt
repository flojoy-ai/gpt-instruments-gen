Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2450 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2450

# Create a connection to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
keithley = Keithley2450(adapter)

# Configure the instrument
keithley.apply_current()
keithley.source_current_range = 10e-3
keithley.compliance_voltage = 10
keithley.source_current = 0
keithley.enable_source()

# Perform measurements
keithley.measure_voltage()
keithley.ramp_to_current(5e-3)
print(keithley.voltage)

# Shutdown the instrument
keithley.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 2450 Power Supply using a VISA adapter with the GPIB address "GPIB::1". It then configures the instrument to apply a current, sets the current range, compliance voltage, and source current. It enables the source output and performs voltage measurements. It ramps the current to 5 mA and prints the measured voltage. Finally, it shuts down the instrument by ramping the current to 0 mA and disabling the output.
