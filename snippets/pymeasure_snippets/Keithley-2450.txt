Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2450 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2450

# Create a connection to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
keithley = Keithley2450(adapter)

# Enable the source and set the current range
keithley.enable_source()
keithley.source_current_range = 10e-3

# Set the compliance voltage and source current
keithley.compliance_voltage = 10
keithley.source_current = 0

# Measure voltage
keithley.measure_voltage()

# Ramp the current to 5 mA and print the voltage
keithley.ramp_to_current(5e-3)
print(keithley.voltage)

# Shutdown the instrument
keithley.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 2450 Power Supply using a VISA adapter with the address "GPIB::1". It enables the source, sets the current range to 10 mA, sets the compliance voltage to 10 V, and sets the source current to 0 mA. It then measures the voltage, ramps the current to 5 mA, and prints the voltage. Finally, it shuts down the instrument.
