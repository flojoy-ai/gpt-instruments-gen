```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import SG380

# Create a VISA adapter for communication with the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the SG380 RF Signal Generator
sg = SG380(adapter)

# Connect to the instrument
sg.open()

# Access the properties and methods of the instrument
frequency = sg.frequency
print("Current frequency: {} Hz".format(frequency))

sg.frequency = 1E6
print("Frequency set to 1 MHz")

mod_type = sg.mod_type
print("Current modulation type: {}".format(mod_type))

sg.mod_type = 'AM'
print("Modulation type set to AM")

# Close the connection to the instrument
sg.close()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to an SG380 RF Signal Generator using Pymeasure. It creates a VISA adapter for communication, creates an instance of the SG380 instrument, opens the connection, and then accesses and sets various properties of the instrument. Finally, it closes the connection.
