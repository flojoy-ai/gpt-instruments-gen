Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SG 380 RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import SG380

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SG 380 RF Signal Generator
sg = SG380(adapter)

# Get the RF frequency
frequency = sg.frequency
print("RF Frequency:", frequency)

# Set the RF frequency to 1 GHz
sg.frequency = 1E9

# Get the modulation type
mod_type = sg.mod_type
print("Modulation Type:", mod_type)

# Set the modulation type to AM
sg.mod_type = 'AM'

# Get the modulation function
mod_function = sg.mod_function
print("Modulation Function:", mod_function)

# Set the modulation function to SINE
sg.mod_function = 'SINE'

# Close the connection to the instrument
sg.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the SG 380 RF Signal Generator using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `SG380` class. It then demonstrates how to get and set various properties of the instrument, such as the RF frequency, modulation type, and modulation function. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
