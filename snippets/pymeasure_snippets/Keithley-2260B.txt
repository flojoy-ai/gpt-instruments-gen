Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2260B Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2260B

# Create a connection to the Keithley 2260B Power Supply
power_supply = Keithley2260B("GPIB::1")

# Enable the output of the power supply
power_supply.output_enabled = True

# Set the voltage setpoint to 5 volts
power_supply.voltage_setpoint = 5

# Read the voltage, current, and power values from the power supply
voltage = power_supply.voltage
current = power_supply.current
power = power_supply.power

# Print the values
print("Voltage: {} V".format(voltage))
print("Current: {} A".format(current))
print("Power: {} W".format(power))

# Disable the output of the power supply
power_supply.output_enabled = False

# Close the connection to the power supply
power_supply.shutdown()
```

This script connects to a Keithley 2260B Power Supply using the GPIB interface. It enables the output of the power supply, sets the voltage setpoint to 5 volts, and then reads the voltage, current, and power values from the power supply. Finally, it disables the output of the power supply and closes the connection.
