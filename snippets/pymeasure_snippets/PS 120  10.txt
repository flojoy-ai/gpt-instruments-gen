Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a PS 120-10 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import GPIBAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import PS120_10

# Create a GPIB adapter
adapter = GPIBAdapter(address="GPIB::25")

# Create an instance of the PS120_10 instrument
ps = PS120_10(adapter)

# Enable control of the power supply
ps.enable_control()

# Train the magnet
ps.train_magnet([
    (11.8, 1.0),
    (13.9, 0.4),
    (14.9, 0.2),
    (16.0, 0.1),
])

# Set the field to 12 T
ps.set_field(12)

# Print the current field
print(ps.field)

# Set the field to 0 T
ps.set_field(0)

# Disable control of the power supply
ps.disable_control()
```

This script first creates a GPIB adapter using the `GPIBAdapter` class from Pymeasure. It then creates an instance of the `PS120_10` instrument, passing the adapter as an argument.

The script then enables control of the power supply using the `enable_control()` method. It trains the magnet by calling the `train_magnet()` method with a list of field and current values.

Next, it sets the field to 12 T using the `set_field()` method and prints the current field using the `field` property.

After that, it sets the field to 0 T and finally disables control of the power supply using the `disable_control()` method.

Note: Make sure you have Pymeasure installed (`pip install pymeasure`) and the appropriate GPIB driver for your system.
