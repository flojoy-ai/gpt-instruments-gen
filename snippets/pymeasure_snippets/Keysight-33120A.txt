Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 33120A Function Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import HP33120A

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::10::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = HP33120A(adapter)

# Set the waveform shape to sinusoid
instrument.shape = 'sinusoid'

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
instrument.frequency = 1000

# Set the amplitude to 1 Vpp
instrument.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
instrument.output = True

# Generate a beep
instrument.beep()

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

This script first creates a VISA adapter using the GPIB address of the instrument. Then, it creates an instance of the `HP33120A` class, passing the adapter as an argument. It sets the waveform shape to sinusoid, frequency to 1 kHz, and amplitude to 1 Vpp. It enables the output and generates a beep. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
