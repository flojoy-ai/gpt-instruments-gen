Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ESP 300 Positional Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.newport import ESP300

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the ESP 300 controller
controller = ESP300(adapter)

# Enable motion for all axes
controller.enable()

# Move the X axis to a specific position
controller.x.position = 10

# Move the Y axis to a specific position
controller.y.position = 20

# Move the Phi axis to a specific position
controller.phi.position = 30

# Wait for all axes to stop moving
controller.x.wait_for_stop()
controller.y.wait_for_stop()
controller.phi.wait_for_stop()

# Disable motion for all axes
controller.disable()

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the ESP 300 controller using a VISA adapter, enables motion for all axes, moves each axis to a specific position, waits for all axes to stop moving, disables motion for all axes, and finally closes the connection to the controller.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB0::1::INSTR"` with the appropriate address of your ESP 300 controller.
