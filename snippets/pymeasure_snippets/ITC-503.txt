Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ITC 503 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.oxford.itc503 import ITC503

# Connect to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller
itc = ITC503("GPIB::24")

# Set the control mode to remote
itc.control_mode = "RU"

# Turn on auto heater and flow
itc.heater_gas_mode = "AUTO"

# Turn on auto-pid
itc.auto_pid = True

# Print the current set-point
print(itc.temperature_setpoint)

# Change the set-point to 300 K
itc.temperature_setpoint = 300

# Wait for the temperature to stabilize
itc.wait_for_temperature()

# Print the temperature at sensor 1
print(itc.temperature_1)
```

This script connects to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller using the GPIB interface with address 24. It sets the control mode to remote, turns on auto heater and flow, and enables auto-pid. It then prints the current temperature set-point, changes the set-point to 300 K, waits for the temperature to stabilize, and finally prints the temperature at sensor 1.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate GPIB driver for your system.
