```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.temptronic.eco560 import ECO560

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the ECO560 instrument
eco560 = ECO560(adapter)

# Connect to the instrument
eco560.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
# ...

# Disconnect from the instrument
eco560.disconnect()
```

This script uses Pymeasure to connect to an ECO 560 Temperature Controller. It creates a VISA adapter for communication, creates an instance of the ECO560 instrument, connects to the instrument, performs operations with the instrument (which are not shown in the provided code), and finally disconnects from the instrument.
