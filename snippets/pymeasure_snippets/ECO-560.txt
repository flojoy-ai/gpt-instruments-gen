```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.temptronic.eco560 import ECO560

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the ECO560 instrument
eco560 = ECO560(adapter)

# Connect to the instrument
eco560.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
temperature = eco560.temperature
print("Current temperature:", temperature)

# Disconnect from the instrument
eco560.disconnect()
```

This script uses Pymeasure to connect to an ECO 560 Temperature Controller. It creates a VISA adapter for communication, creates an instance of the ECO560 instrument, connects to the instrument, retrieves the current temperature, and then disconnects from the instrument.
