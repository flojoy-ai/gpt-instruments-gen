Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.lakeshore import LakeShore331

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller
controller = LakeShore331(adapter)

# Print the current setpoint for output 1
print(controller.output_1.setpoint)

# Change the setpoint for output 1 to 50 K
controller.output_1.setpoint = 50

# Change the heater range for output 1 to low
controller.output_1.heater_range = 'low'

# Wait for the temperature to stabilize on input A
controller.input_A.wait_for_temperature()

# Print the temperature at input A
print(controller.input_A.temperature)
```

This script first creates a VISA adapter using the `VISAAdapter` class from Pymeasure. The adapter is initialized with the address of the Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller, which is "GPIB::1" in this example.

Then, the script creates an instance of the `LakeShore331` class, passing the adapter as the argument. This represents the connection to the temperature controller.

The script then demonstrates some basic operations on the temperature controller. It prints the current setpoint for output 1, changes the setpoint to 50 K, changes the heater range to low for output 1, waits for the temperature to stabilize on input A, and finally prints the temperature at input A.

Note that this script assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, including Pymeasure and the appropriate VISA library for your instrument.
