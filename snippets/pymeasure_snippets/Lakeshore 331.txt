Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.lakeshore import LakeShore331

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller
controller = LakeShore331(adapter)

# Access the properties and methods of the controller
print(controller.output_1.setpoint)         # Print the current setpoint for loop 1
controller.output_1.setpoint = 50           # Change the loop 1 setpoint to 50 K
controller.output_1.heater_range = 'low'    # Change the heater range to low.
controller.input_A.wait_for_temperature()   # Wait for the temperature to stabilize.
print(controller.input_A.temperature)       # Print the temperature at sensor A

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.disconnect()
```

This script first creates a `VISAAdapter` object to establish communication with the Lakeshore 331 Temperature Controller using the GPIB address "GPIB::1". Then, it creates a `LakeShore331` object, passing the adapter as an argument.

The script then demonstrates how to interact with the controller by accessing its properties and methods. It prints the current setpoint for loop 1, changes the setpoint to 50 K, changes the heater range to low, waits for the temperature at sensor A to stabilize, and finally prints the temperature at sensor A.

Finally, the script closes the connection to the controller by calling the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate VISA library for your instrument.
