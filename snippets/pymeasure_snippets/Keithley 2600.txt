Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2600:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2600

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Keithley 2600 instrument
keithley = Keithley2600(adapter)

# Perform operations with the instrument
keithley.ChA.source_voltage = 1.0
voltage = keithley.ChA.voltage
print("Measured voltage:", voltage)

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script connects to a Keithley 2600 instrument using a VISA adapter. It sets the source voltage of Channel A to 1.0 V and then measures the voltage. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
