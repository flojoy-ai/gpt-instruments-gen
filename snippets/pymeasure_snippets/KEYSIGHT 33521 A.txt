Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a KEYSIGHT 33521A RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Agilent33500

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the KEYSIGHT 33521A RF Signal Generator
generator = Agilent33500(adapter)

# Set the output waveform shape to sine
generator.shape = 'SIN'

# Set the output frequency to 1 kHz
generator.frequency = 1e3

# Set the output amplitude to 1 Vpp
generator.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
generator.output = True

# Disconnect from the instrument
generator.disconnect()
```

This script first creates a VISA adapter using the `VISAAdapter` class from Pymeasure. The adapter is initialized with the VISA address of the instrument, in this case, "GPIB::1".

Then, an instance of the `Agilent33500` class is created, passing the VISA adapter as the argument. This class represents the KEYSIGHT 33521A RF Signal Generator.

The script then sets the desired properties of the signal generator, such as the waveform shape, frequency, amplitude, and output state.

Finally, the script disconnects from the instrument by calling the `disconnect()` method of the signal generator.

Note: Make sure to replace "GPIB::1" with the actual VISA address of your KEYSIGHT 33521A RF Signal Generator.
