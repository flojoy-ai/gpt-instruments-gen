Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2450 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2450

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Keithley 2450 Power Supply
keithley = Keithley2450(adapter)

# Configure the instrument
keithley.apply_current()
keithley.source_current_range = 10e-3
keithley.compliance_voltage = 10
keithley.source_current = 0
keithley.enable_source()

# Measure voltage
keithley.measure_voltage()

# Ramp the current to 5 mA
keithley.ramp_to_current(5e-3)

# Print the voltage
print(keithley.voltage)

# Shutdown the instrument
keithley.shutdown()
```

This script first creates a VISA adapter using the `VISAAdapter` class from Pymeasure. The adapter is then used to connect to the Keithley 2450 Power Supply by creating an instance of the `Keithley2450` class.

The script then configures the instrument by setting the source mode to current, the current range to 10 mA, the compliance voltage to 10 V, and the source current to 0 mA. It then enables the source output.

Next, it configures the instrument to measure voltage.

After that, it ramps the current to 5 mA using the `ramp_to_current` method.

Finally, it prints the measured voltage and shuts down the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB::1"` with the appropriate address of your Keithley 2450 Power Supply.
