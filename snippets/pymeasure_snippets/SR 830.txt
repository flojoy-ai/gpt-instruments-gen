Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SR 830 Lock-in Amplifier:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.srs import SR830

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
lia = SR830("GPIB0::8::INSTR")

# Set the lock-in amplifier parameters
lia.frequency = 1000  # Set the lock-in frequency to 1 kHz
lia.sensitivity = 1e-6  # Set the sensitivity to 1 ÂµV
lia.time_constant = 1e-3  # Set the time constant to 1 ms

# Read the X and Y values
x = lia.x
y = lia.y

# Print the X and Y values
print("X: ", x)
print("Y: ", y)

# Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier
lia.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the lock-in amplifier using the GPIB interface (assuming the lock-in amplifier is connected to GPIB address 8). It then sets the lock-in frequency, sensitivity, and time constant. Finally, it reads the X and Y values from the lock-in amplifier and prints them.
