Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2750 Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2750

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::22::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the Keithley2750 instrument
multimeter = Keithley2750(adapter)

# Open a connection to the instrument
multimeter.open()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument
# For example, to read the list of closed channels:
closed_channels = multimeter.closed_channels

# Close the connection to the instrument
multimeter.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB0::22::INSTR"` with the appropriate address of your Keithley 2750 Multimeter.
