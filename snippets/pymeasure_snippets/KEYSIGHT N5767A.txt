Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a KEYSIGHT N5767A Power Supply:

```python

        ":CURR?", ":CURR %g",
        """ A floating point property that controls the DC current range in
        Amps, which can take values from 0 to 25 A.
        Auto-range is disabled when this property is set. """,
        validator=truncated_range,
        values=[0, 25],
    )

    def is_enabled(self):

        return bool(self._status)

    def __init__(self, adapter, name="Keysight N5767A power supply", **kwargs):

This script defines a class `KeysightN5767A` that represents the KEYSIGHT N5767A Power Supply. It provides methods and properties to control and measure the current and voltage of the power supply.

To use this script, you need to have Pymeasure installed and import the necessary modules. Then, you can create an instance of the `KeysightN5767A` class and use its methods and properties to interact with the power supply.
