Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ATS 525 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.temptronic.ats525 import ATS525

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the ATS 525 Temperature Controller
ats525 = ATS525(adapter)

# Perform measurements or operations on the instrument
current = ats525.system_current

# Print the operating current
print(current)

# Disconnect from the instrument
ats525.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. Create a VISA adapter by providing the appropriate connection details (e.g., IP address).
3. Create an instance of the `ATS525` class, passing the adapter as an argument.
4. Perform any desired measurements or operations on the instrument. In this example, we retrieve the operating current using the `system_current` attribute.
5. Print the operating current.
6. Disconnect from the instrument to release any resources.

Note: Make sure to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual connection details of your ATS 525 Temperature Controller.
