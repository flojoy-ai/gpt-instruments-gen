Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 8116A Function Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import GPIBAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.hp import HP8116A

# Connect to the instrument
adapter = GPIBAdapter(address=1)
instrument = HP8116A(adapter)

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
instrument.frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude to 1 V
instrument.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
instrument.output_enabled = True

# Wait for 5 seconds
import time
time.sleep(5)

# Disable the output
instrument.output_enabled = False

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the instrument using a GPIB adapter with address 1. It then sets the frequency to 1 kHz and the amplitude to 1 V. It enables the output, waits for 5 seconds, and then disables the output. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
