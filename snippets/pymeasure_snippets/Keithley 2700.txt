Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2700 Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2700

# Connect to the Keithley 2700
keithley = Keithley2700("GPIB::1")

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument
# For example, to get the state of channels 1 and 2:
state = keithley.get_state_of_channels([1, 2])
print("State of channels 1 and 2:", state)

# Close all channels
keithley.open_all_channels()

# Close specific channels
keithley.closed_channels = [1, 2, 3]

# Open specific channels
keithley.open_channels = [1, 2, 3]

# Close rows to columns on the 7709 connection matrix
keithley.close_rows_to_columns([1, 2], [3, 4], slot=1)

# Open rows to columns on the 7709 connection matrix
keithley.open_rows_to_columns([1, 2], [3, 4], slot=1)

# Perform other operations as needed

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to a Keithley 2700 Multimeter using Pymeasure and perform various operations such as getting the state of channels, closing/opening channels, and controlling the 7709 connection matrix.
