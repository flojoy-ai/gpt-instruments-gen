Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight DSOX1102G Oscilloscope:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import KeysightDSOX1102G

# Connect to the oscilloscope
adapter = VISAAdapter("USB0::0x0957::0x179B::MY44012345::INSTR")
oscilloscope = KeysightDSOX1102G(adapter)

# Perform some operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.clear_status()
oscilloscope.autoscale()
ch1_data, ch1_preamble = oscilloscope.download_data(source="channel1", points=2000)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.shutdown()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules from Pymeasure. We then create a `VISAAdapter` object to connect to the oscilloscope using its VISA address. Next, we create a `KeysightDSOX1102G` object using the adapter.

We can then perform various operations on the oscilloscope, such as clearing the status, autoscaling the channels, and downloading data from channel 1. Finally, we call the `shutdown()` method to disconnect from the oscilloscope.

Note: Make sure to replace the VISA address in the `VISAAdapter` constructor with the correct address for your oscilloscope.
