Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ITC 503 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import OxfordITC503

# Connect to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller
itc = OxfordITC503("GPIB::24")

# Set the control mode to remote
itc.control_mode = "RU"

# Turn on auto heater and flow
itc.heater_gas_mode = "AUTO"

# Turn on auto-pid
itc.auto_pid = True

# Print the current set-point
print(itc.temperature_setpoint)

# Change the set-point to 300 K
itc.temperature_setpoint = 300

# Wait for the temperature to stabilize
itc.wait_for_temperature()

# Print the temperature at sensor 1
print(itc.temperature_1)
```

This script connects to the ITC 503 Temperature Controller using the GPIB address "GPIB::24". It sets the control mode to remote, turns on auto heater and flow, and enables auto-pid. It then prints the current set-point temperature, changes the set-point to 300 K, waits for the temperature to stabilize, and finally prints the temperature at sensor 1.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Pymeasure and the GPIB driver for your specific hardware.
