Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SR 830 Lock-in Amplifier:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.srs import SR830

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
lia = SR830("GPIB0::8::INSTR")

# Set the lock-in amplifier parameters
lia.frequency = 1000  # Set the lock-in frequency to 1 kHz
lia.sensitivity = 1e-6  # Set the sensitivity to 1 µV
lia.time_constant = 1e-3  # Set the time constant to 1 ms

# Read the X and Y values
x = lia.x
y = lia.y

# Print the X and Y values
print("X: ", x)
print("Y: ", y)

# Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier
lia.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `SR830` class from the `pymeasure.instruments.srs` module. We then create an instance of the `SR830` class, passing the GPIB address of the lock-in amplifier as the argument.

Next, we set the lock-in amplifier parameters using the properties provided by the `SR830` class. In this example, we set the lock-in frequency to 1 kHz, sensitivity to 1 µV, and time constant to 1 ms.

We then read the X and Y values from the lock-in amplifier using the `x` and `y` properties provided by the `SR830` class.

Finally, we print the X and Y values and disconnect from the lock-in amplifier.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate GPIB driver for your system.
