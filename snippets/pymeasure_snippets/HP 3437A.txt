Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a HP 3437A Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import PrologixAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.hp import HP3437A

# Create a PrologixAdapter object to connect to the instrument
adapter = PrologixAdapter("GPIB0::10::INSTR")

# Create an HP3437A object using the adapter
multimeter = HP3437A(adapter)

# Open the connection to the instrument
multimeter.open()

# Set the measurement range to 1V
multimeter.range = 1

# Set the number of readings to 10
multimeter.number_readings = 10

# Read the measured data
data = multimeter.read_data()

# Print the measured data
print(data)

# Close the connection to the instrument
multimeter.close()
```

This script connects to the HP 3437A Multimeter using a PrologixAdapter, sets the measurement range to 1V, sets the number of readings to 10, reads the measured data, and then prints the data. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
