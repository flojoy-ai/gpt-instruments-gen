To connect to a SM 70-45D Power Supply using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import Instrument
from pymeasure.instruments.validators import strict_range
from time import sleep
from numpy import linspace

class SM7045D(Instrument):
    # Class definition goes here

# Create an instance of the SM7045D class
source = SM7045D("GPIB::8")

# Example usage of the power supply
source.ramp_to_zero(1)               # Set output to 0 before enabling
source.enable()                      # Enables the output
source.current = 1                   # Sets a current of 1 Amps
```

This script creates an instance of the `SM7045D` class, which represents the SM 70-45D Power Supply. You can then use the various methods and properties of the `source` object to control and measure the power supply.

The example usage provided in the script ramps the current to zero, enables the output, and sets the current to 1 Amp.
