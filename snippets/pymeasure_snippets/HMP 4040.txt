Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a HMP 4040 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import HMP4040

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the HMP4040 Power Supply
power_supply = HMP4040(adapter)

# Perform operations on the power supply
power_supply.beep()
power_supply.control_method = "REM"
voltage = power_supply.voltage
current = power_supply.current

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the HMP4040 Power Supply using a VISA adapter with the IP address "192.168.1.1". It then performs some operations on the power supply, such as emitting a beep, setting the control method to remote, and reading the voltage and current values. Finally, it disconnects from the power supply.

Note: Replace "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR" with the appropriate VISA address for your specific setup.
