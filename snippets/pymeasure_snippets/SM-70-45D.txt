Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SM 70-45D Power Supply:

This script defines a class `SM7045D` that represents the SM 70-45 D power supply. It provides methods to control the power supply, such as setting the voltage and current, enabling/disabling the output, and ramping the current up or down. The script also includes an example usage at the end, where it connects to the power supply and performs some operations.
