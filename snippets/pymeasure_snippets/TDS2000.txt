```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Instrument
from pymeasure.instruments.tektronix import TDS2000

# Create a VISA adapter
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the TDS2000 Oscilloscope
scope = TDS2000(adapter)

# Perform measurements
scope.measurement.source = 'CH1'
scope.measurement.type = 'FREQ'
scope.measurement.unit = 'Hz'
value = scope.measurement.value

# Disconnect from the instrument
scope.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. Create a VISA adapter with the appropriate address for your TDS2000 Oscilloscope.
3. Connect to the TDS2000 Oscilloscope using the adapter.
4. Set the measurement source, type, and unit using the `scope.measurement` object.
5. Retrieve the measurement value using the `scope.measurement.value` property.
6. Disconnect from the instrument to release the resources.
