Sure! Here's an example of a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an adapter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import Adapter

# Create an instance of the Adapter class
adapter = Adapter()

# Connect to the adapter
adapter.open()

# Send a command to the adapter
adapter.send("COMMAND")

# Receive a response from the adapter
response = adapter.recv()

# Print the response
print(response)

# Close the connection to the adapter
adapter.close()
```

In this example, we import the `Adapter` class from the `pymeasure.adapters` module. We then create an instance of the `Adapter` class and call the `open()` method to establish a connection to the adapter. We can then use the `send()` method to send commands to the adapter and the `recv()` method to receive responses from the adapter. Finally, we close the connection to the adapter using the `close()` method.

Note that you will need to replace `"COMMAND"` with the actual command you want to send to the adapter.
