```python
from pymeasure.instruments.danfysik import Danfysik8500

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply = Danfysik8500("COM1")

# Set the voltage to 10 V
power_supply.voltage = 10

# Set the current limit to 2 A
power_supply.current_limit = 2

# Enable the output
power_supply.output = True

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `Danfysik8500` class from the `pymeasure.instruments.danfysik` module.
2. Create an instance of the `Danfysik8500` class and pass the serial port (e.g., "COM1") as an argument to connect to the power supply.
3. Set the voltage to 10 V by assigning the desired value to the `voltage` attribute of the power supply object.
4. Set the current limit to 2 A by assigning the desired value to the `current_limit` attribute of the power supply object.
5. Enable the output by assigning `True` to the `output` attribute of the power supply object.
6. Disconnect from the power supply by calling the `disconnect()` method of the power supply object.
