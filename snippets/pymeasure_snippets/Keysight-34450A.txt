Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 34450A Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Agilent34450A

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("USB0::0x2A8D::0x0101::MY53200001::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the Agilent34450A instrument
dmm = Agilent34450A(adapter)

# Reset the instrument
dmm.reset()

# Configure the instrument to measure DC voltage
dmm.configure_voltage()

# Read the voltage measurement
voltage = dmm.voltage
print("Voltage:", voltage)

# Shutdown the instrument
dmm.shutdown()
```

In this example, we first import the necessary modules from Pymeasure. We then create a VISA adapter using the appropriate address for your instrument. Next, we create an instance of the Agilent34450A instrument using the adapter. We can then use the instrument's methods and properties to interact with the multimeter. In this case, we reset the instrument, configure it to measure DC voltage, read the voltage measurement, and finally shutdown the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace the address "USB0::0x2A8D::0x0101::MY53200001::INSTR" with the actual address of your instrument.
