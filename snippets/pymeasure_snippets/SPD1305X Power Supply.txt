To connect to a SPD1305X Power Supply using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.siglenttechnologies import SPD1305X

# Create a VISA adapter
adapter = VISAAdapter("USB0::0xF4EC::0xEE3A::SPD13A1R3L0001::INSTR")

# Connect to the SPD1305X Power Supply
power_supply = SPD1305X(adapter)

# Perform operations on the power supply
power_supply.ch_1.voltage = 10  # Set the voltage of channel 1 to 10V
power_supply.ch_1.current_limit = 2  # Set the current limit of channel 1 to 2A

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script uses the `VISAAdapter` from Pymeasure to create a connection to the power supply using the VISA address. Then, it creates an instance of the `SPD1305X` class and assigns it to the `power_supply` variable. You can perform operations on the power supply, such as setting the voltage and current limit of channel 1, by accessing the `ch_1` attribute of the `power_supply` object. Finally, the script disconnects from the power supply using the `disconnect()` method.
