Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Gemini GV6 motor controller:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.parker import ParkerGV6

# Create an instance of the ParkerGV6 instrument
motor = ParkerGV6("ASRL1::INSTR")

# Connect to the motor controller
motor.connect()

# Enable the motor
motor.enable()

# Set the motor velocity to 5 revolutions per second
motor.velocity = 5

# Move the motor to a specific angle
motor.angle = 90

# Check if the motor is currently moving
is_moving = motor.is_moving()

# Disable the motor
motor.disable()

# Disconnect from the motor controller
motor.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `ParkerGV6` instrument, connects to the motor controller using the specified address (e.g., `"ASRL1::INSTR"`), enables the motor, sets the velocity, moves the motor to a specific angle, checks if the motor is moving, disables the motor, and finally disconnects from the motor controller.
