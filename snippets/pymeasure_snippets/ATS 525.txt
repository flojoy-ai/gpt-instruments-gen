Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an ATS 525 Temperature Controller:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.temptronic.ats525 import ATS525

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the ATS 525 Temperature Controller
ats525 = ATS525(adapter)

# Perform measurements or operations on the instrument
current = ats525.system_current

# Print the operating current
print(current)

# Disconnect from the instrument
ats525.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. First, we import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. We create a `VISAAdapter` object, specifying the VISA address of the instrument. Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your ATS 525 Temperature Controller.
3. We create an `ATS525` object, passing the adapter as an argument.
4. We can now perform measurements or operations on the instrument. In this example, we retrieve the operating current by accessing the `system_current` attribute of the `ATS525` object.
5. Finally, we print the operating current and disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure`, `pyvisa`, and the appropriate VISA library for your instrument.
