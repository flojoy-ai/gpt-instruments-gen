Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.yokogawa import Yokogawa7651

# Connect to the Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply
yoko = Yokogawa7651("GPIB::1")

# Apply a current of 1 mA with a compliance voltage of 1 V
yoko.apply_current(max_current=1e-3, compliance_voltage=1)

# Enable the source
yoko.enable_source()

# Ramp the current to 5 mA over 0.5 seconds
yoko.ramp_to_current(5e-3, steps=25, duration=0.5)

# Shutdown the instrument
yoko.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply using the GPIB address "GPIB::1". It applies a current of 1 mA with a compliance voltage of 1 V using the `apply_current` method. Then, it enables the source using the `enable_source` method. Next, it ramps the current to 5 mA over 0.5 seconds using the `ramp_to_current` method. Finally, it shuts down the instrument using the `shutdown` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate GPIB driver for your system.
