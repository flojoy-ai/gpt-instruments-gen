Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2306 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2306

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")  # Replace with your instrument's IP address

# Connect to the Keithley 2306 Power Supply
power_supply = Keithley2306(adapter)

# Enable both channels
power_supply.both_channels_enabled = True

# Set the voltage and current limits for channel 1
power_supply.ch(1).source_voltage = 5.0  # Set the voltage to 5V
power_supply.ch(1).source_current_limit = 1.0  # Set the current limit to 1A

# Enable channel 1
power_supply.ch(1).enabled = True

# Measure the voltage and current on channel 1
voltage = power_supply.ch(1).measured_voltage
current = power_supply.ch(1).measured_current

print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Current: {current} A")

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the appropriate VISA address for your Keithley 2306 Power Supply.
