Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2306 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2306

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the Keithley 2306 Power Supply
power_supply = Keithley2306(adapter)

# Enable both channels
power_supply.both_channels_enabled = True

# Set the voltage and current limits for channel 1
power_supply.ch(1).source_voltage = 5.0
power_supply.ch(1).source_current_limit = 1.0

# Set the voltage and current limits for channel 2
power_supply.ch(2).source_voltage = 3.3
power_supply.ch(2).source_current_limit = 0.5

# Enable the output for both channels
power_supply.ch(1).enabled = True
power_supply.ch(2).enabled = True

# Measure the voltage and current for channel 1
voltage = power_supply.ch(1).measured_voltage
current = power_supply.ch(1).measured_current

print(f"Channel 1: Voltage = {voltage} V, Current = {current} A")

# Measure the voltage and current for channel 2
voltage = power_supply.ch(2).measured_voltage
current = power_supply.ch(2).measured_current

print(f"Channel 2: Voltage = {voltage} V, Current = {current} A")

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script connects to a Keithley 2306 Power Supply using a VISA adapter and sets the voltage and current limits for both channels. It then enables the output for both channels and measures the voltage and current for each channel. Finally, it disconnects from the power supply.
