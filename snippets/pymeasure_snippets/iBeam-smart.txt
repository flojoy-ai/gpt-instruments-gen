Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an iBeam Smart laser:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.toptica import IBeamSmart

# Create a VISA adapter and connect to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("SomeResourceString")
laser = IBeamSmart(adapter)

# Set the output power of channel 2 to 1000 µW
laser.ch_2.power = 1000

# Enable channel 2
laser.ch_2.enabled = True

# Shutdown the laser
laser.shutdown()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. Create a `VISAAdapter` object by providing the resource string of the instrument.
3. Create an `IBeamSmart` object by passing the adapter to it.
4. Set the output power of channel 2 to 1000 µW by assigning the desired value to the `power` attribute of `ch_2`.
5. Enable channel 2 by assigning `True` to the `enabled` attribute of `ch_2`.
6. Shutdown the laser by calling the `shutdown` method of the `laser` object.
