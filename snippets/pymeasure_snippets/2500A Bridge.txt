Sure! Here's an example script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a 2500A Bridge Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2500

# Connect to the instrument
meter = Keithley2500("GPIB::1::INSTR")

# Initialize the instrument
meter.reset()
meter.beep(1000, 0.1)

# Set the measurement mode to resistance
meter.mode = "RES"

# Perform a resistance measurement
resistance = meter.resistance

# Print the measured resistance
print("Resistance: {} Ohms".format(resistance))

# Disconnect from the instrument
meter.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 2500A Bridge Multimeter using the GPIB interface. It initializes the instrument, sets the measurement mode to resistance, performs a resistance measurement, and prints the measured resistance. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB::1::INSTR"` with the correct address of your instrument.
