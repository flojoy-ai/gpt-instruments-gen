Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a 2500A Bridge Multimeter:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import AH2500A

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the AH2500A instrument
bridge = AH2500A(adapter)

# Perform a single capacitance and loss measurement
capacitance, loss, voltage = bridge.caplossvolt

# Print the measurement values
print(f"Capacitance: {capacitance} pF")
print(f"Loss: {loss} nS")
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")

# Disconnect from the instrument
bridge.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the AH2500A instrument using a VISA adapter, performs a single capacitance and loss measurement, and prints the measurement values. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
