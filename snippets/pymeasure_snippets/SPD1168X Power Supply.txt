Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a SPD1168X Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.siglenttechnologies import SPD1168X

# Create a VISA adapter for communication with the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("USB0::0xF4EC::0xEE3A::SPD1168X-1000-1168X-1000-1168XN1P1R1::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the SPD1168X power supply
power_supply = SPD1168X(adapter)

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Now you can use the power supply to perform various operations
# For example, to set the output voltage to 5V:
power_supply.ch_1.voltage = 5

# To turn on the output:
power_supply.ch_1.output_enabled = True

# To read the current output voltage:
voltage = power_supply.ch_1.voltage

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the VISA address in the `VISAAdapter` constructor with the appropriate address for your instrument.
