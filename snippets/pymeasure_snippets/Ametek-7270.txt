Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an Ametek 7270 Lockin Amplifier:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.ametek import Ametek7270

# Create a connection to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1::INSTR")
lockin = Ametek7270(adapter)

# Set the instrument to voltage control mode
lockin.set_voltage_mode()

# Set the sensitivity to 100 nV
lockin.sensitivity = 100e-9

# Set the filter slope to 12 dB/octave
lockin.slope = 12

# Read the X and Y values
x_value = lockin.x
y_value = lockin.y

# Print the X and Y values
print("X value:", x_value)
print("Y value:", y_value)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lockin.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the Ametek 7270 Lockin Amplifier using a VISA adapter and sets the instrument to voltage control mode. It then sets the sensitivity to 100 nV and the filter slope to 12 dB/octave. The script reads the X and Y values from the lockin amplifier and prints them. Finally, it shuts down the instrument and closes the connection.

Note: Make sure to install the necessary dependencies (`pymeasure`, `pyvisa`, and `pyvisa-py`) before running the script.
