Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to an Ametek 7270 Lockin Amplifier:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.ametek import Ametek7270

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
lockin = Ametek7270("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Set the reference frequency to 1 kHz
lockin.frequency = 1000

# Set the input configuration to A-B mode
lockin.input_configuration = 'AB'

# Enable the internal reference oscillator
lockin.reference_oscillator = 'internal'

# Enable the input filter
lockin.input_filter = True

# Read the X and Y components of the signal
x = lockin.X
y = lockin.Y

# Print the X and Y values
print("X:", x)
print("Y:", y)

# Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier
lockin.disconnect()
```

This script first imports the `Ametek7270` class from the `pymeasure.instruments.ametek` module. It then creates an instance of the `Ametek7270` class, specifying the GPIB address of the lock-in amplifier.

The script then sets various parameters of the lock-in amplifier, such as the reference frequency, input configuration, reference oscillator, and input filter. These parameters can be adjusted according to your specific requirements.

Next, the script reads the X and Y components of the signal using the `X` and `Y` properties of the lock-in amplifier object. These properties return the corresponding values as floating-point numbers.

Finally, the script prints the X and Y values and disconnects from the lock-in amplifier using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate GPIB driver for your system.
