Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to an ERASYNTH RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.erainstruments.ERASynth import ERASynth

# Connect to the ERASynth RF Signal Generator
erasynth = ERASynth('erasynth', 'COM3', baudrate=115200)

# Print the instrument ID
print(erasynth.IDN())

# Set the frequency to 1 GHz
erasynth.frequency(1e9)

# Set the power level to -10 dBm
erasynth.power(-10)

# Enable the output
erasynth.output(True)

# Disconnect from the instrument
erasynth.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'COM3'` with the correct serial port of your ERASynth RF Signal Generator.
