To connect to a Model 331 Temperature Controller using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_331 import Model_331

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the Model 331 Temperature Controller
model_331 = Model_331('model_331', 'GPIB0::1::INSTR')
station.add_component(model_331)

# Print the heater output
print(model_331.heater_output())

# Set the heater range to 5W
model_331.heater_range('5W')

# Print the temperature of channel A
print(model_331.channels.ChanA.temperature())

# Set the setpoint temperature to 300 K
model_331.setpoint(300)

# Print the setpoint temperature
print(model_331.setpoint())

# Disconnect from the instruments
station.close_all_registered_instruments()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the Model 331 Temperature Controller using the `Model_331` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore` module. The instrument is added to the station using the `add_component` method.

The script then demonstrates some basic operations with the instrument. It prints the heater output using the `heater_output` parameter, sets the heater range to 5W using the `heater_range` parameter, prints the temperature of channel A using the `temperature` parameter of the `SensorChannel` class, sets the setpoint temperature to 300 K using the `setpoint` parameter, and finally prints the setpoint temperature.

Note that you may need to adjust the GPIB address (`'GPIB0::1::INSTR'`) to match the actual address of your instrument.
