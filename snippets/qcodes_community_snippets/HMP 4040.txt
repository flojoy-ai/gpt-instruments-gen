```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Create an instance of the HMP4040 power supply
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
hmp.connect()

# Perform operations with the power supply
# ...

# Disconnect from the power supply
hmp.disconnect()
```

This code imports the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040` module. It then creates an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class named `hmp`, passing the name and address of the power supply as arguments.

The `connect()` method is called to establish a connection with the power supply. You can then perform operations with the power supply using the `hmp` instance. Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to close the connection with the power supply.
