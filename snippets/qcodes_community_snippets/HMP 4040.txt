```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Connect to the HMP4040 Power Supply
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Perform operations on the power supply
hmp.voltage(5)  # Set the output voltage to 5V
hmp.current(1)  # Set the output current to 1A
hmp.output('on')  # Turn on the output

# Disconnect from the power supply
hmp.close()
```

This script imports the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040` module. It then creates an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class named `hmp` by passing the name and address of the power supply as arguments to the constructor.

The script then performs operations on the power supply, such as setting the output voltage and current, and turning on the output. Finally, it closes the connection to the power supply by calling the `close()` method on the `hmp` instance.
