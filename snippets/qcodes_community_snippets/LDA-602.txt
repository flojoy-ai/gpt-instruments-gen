To connect to a LDA-602 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-602 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=602)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure you have the necessary DLL files (`VNX_atten64.dll` for 64-bit Windows or `VNX_atten.dll` for 32-bit Windows) in the appropriate directory and that the `Vaunix_LDA` driver is installed.
