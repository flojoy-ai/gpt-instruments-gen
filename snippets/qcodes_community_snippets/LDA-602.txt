To connect to a LDA-602 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-602 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=602)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure you have installed the `qcodes-contrib-drivers` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install qcodes-contrib-drivers
```

Note that you may need to adjust the serial number and other parameters based on your specific setup.
