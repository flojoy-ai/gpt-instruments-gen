Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-5018V Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-5018V Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=5018)

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the instrument
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lda.close()
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary DLL files (`VNX_atten64.dll` or `VNX_atten.dll`) in the correct directory and set the `dll_path` accordingly in the script.
