```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Create an instance of the HMP4040 power supply
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
hmp.connect()

# Perform operations with the power supply
# ...

# Disconnect from the power supply
hmp.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP` module.
2. Create an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class with the desired name and address of the power supply. In this example, the address is assumed to be `'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR'`. Replace it with the actual address of your power supply.
3. Call the `connect()` method to establish a connection with the power supply.
4. Perform any desired operations with the power supply using the methods and properties provided by the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class.
5. Call the `disconnect()` method to close the connection with the power supply.
