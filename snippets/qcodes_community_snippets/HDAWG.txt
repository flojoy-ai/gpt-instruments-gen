To connect to a HDAWG Wavemeter using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, initialise_or_create_database_at
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import ZIHDAWG8

# Create a database for storing the measurement data
initialise_or_create_database_at('path_to_database')

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the HDAWG instrument
hdawg = ZIHDAWG8('hdawg', 'dev1234')
station.add_component(hdawg)

# Now you can use the HDAWG instrument for measurements
hdawg.enable_channel(1)
hdawg.start_awg(1)

# Close the connection to the instruments
hdawg.close()
```

This script creates a database for storing the measurement data, creates a station to hold the instruments, connects to the HDAWG instrument with the specified device ID, and performs some basic operations on the instrument. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
