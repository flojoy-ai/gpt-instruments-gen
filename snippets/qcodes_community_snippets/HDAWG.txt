To connect to a HDAWG Wavemeter using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.ZI.ZIHDAWG8 import ZIHDAWG8

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the HDAWG Wavemeter
hdawg = ZIHDAWG8('hdawg', 'dev1234')  # Replace 'dev1234' with the actual device ID
station.add_component(hdawg)

# Now you can use the HDAWG Wavemeter
hdawg.enable_channel(1)
hdawg.start_awg(1)

# Disconnect from the instruments
station.close_all_registered_instruments()
```

Note: Replace `'dev1234'` with the actual device ID of your HDAWG Wavemeter.
