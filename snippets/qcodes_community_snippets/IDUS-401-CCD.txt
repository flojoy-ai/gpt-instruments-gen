Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to an Andor IDUS 401 CCD Spectrometer:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Andor.Andor_IDUS import Andor_IDUS

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the IDUS 401 CCD Spectrometer
idus = Andor_IDUS("idus", dll_path="C:\\Program Files\\Andor SDK\\atmcd64d.dll", camera_id=0, setup=True)

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(idus)

# Print the IDN of the instrument
print(idus.IDN())

# Set the exposure time to 1 second
idus.exposure_time(1)

# Start the acquisition
idus.start_acquisition()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
idus.wait_for_acquisition()

# Get the acquired data
data = idus.get_acquired_data()

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Close the instrument connection
idus.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the `dll_path` with the correct path to the `atmcd64d.dll` file on your system.
