Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a Kelvinox IGH Dilution Refrigerator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.oxford.Kelvinox_IGH import Kelvinox_IGH

# Connect to the dilution refrigerator
dilution_fridge = Kelvinox_IGH("dilution_fridge", "COM1")

# Print the current temperature of the mixing chamber
print(dilution_fridge.mixing_chamber.temperature())

# Close the connection to the dilution refrigerator
dilution_fridge.close()
```

In this example, we import the necessary modules from Qcodes and specifically import the `Kelvinox_IGH` instrument driver for the Kelvinox IGH Dilution Refrigerator. We then create an instance of the `Kelvinox_IGH` class, passing in the name of the instrument and the communication port (e.g., `"COM1"` for a serial connection).

We can then use the various methods provided by the `Kelvinox_IGH` instrument driver to interact with the dilution refrigerator. In this example, we print the current temperature of the mixing chamber using the `temperature()` method.

Finally, we close the connection to the dilution refrigerator using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `"COM1"` with the appropriate communication port for your setup.
