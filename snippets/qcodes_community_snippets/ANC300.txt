To connect to an ANC300 Positional Controller using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Attocube.ANC300 import ANC300

# Create an instance of the ANC300 driver
anc300 = ANC300('anc300', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the ANC300 controller
anc300.connect()

# Perform operations on the ANC300 controller
# For example, you can read the version information
version_info = anc300.version()
print(version_info)

# Close the connection to the ANC300 controller
anc300.close()
```

This script creates an instance of the ANC300 driver and connects to the ANC300 controller using the specified address (replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your ANC300 controller). You can then perform operations on the ANC300 controller, such as reading the version information. Finally, the script closes the connection to the ANC300 controller.
