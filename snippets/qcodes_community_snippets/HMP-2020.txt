Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a HMP 2020 Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP2020 import HMP2020

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply = HMP2020('power_supply', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the power supply IDN
print(power_supply.IDN())

# Set the output voltage to 5V
power_supply.voltage(5)

# Enable the output
power_supply.output('on')

# Disable the output after 2 seconds
qc.sleep(2)
power_supply.output('off')

# Close the connection to the power supply
power_supply.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and the `HMP2020` driver from the `rohde_schwarz` package.

Then, we create an instance of the `HMP2020` driver and connect to the power supply using its IP address. Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address of your power supply.

We can then use the `power_supply` object to interact with the power supply. In this example, we print the power supply's IDN, set the output voltage to 5V, enable the output, wait for 2 seconds, and then disable the output.

Finally, we close the connection to the power supply using `power_supply.close()`.
