Sure! Here's an example code that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a M5180 2-Port 18 GHz Analyzer Network Analyzer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_M5180A import Keysight_M5180A

# Connect to the instrument
m5180 = Keysight_M5180A('m5180', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(m5180.IDN())

# Close the connection
m5180.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your M5180 analyzer.

This code imports the necessary modules, creates an instance of the `Keysight_M5180A` instrument driver, connects to the instrument using the specified VISA address, prints the instrument ID, and finally closes the connection.
