To connect to a Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies using Qcodes Community, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QDevil.QDAC2 import QDac2_Array

# Create an instance of the QDac2_Array driver
qdac_array = QDac2_Array(controller, listeners)

# Connect to the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
qdac_array.sync()

# Perform operations on the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
# ...

# Close the connection to the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
qdac_array.close()
```

In the code above, you need to replace `controller` and `listeners` with the actual instances of the QDac2 instruments that you want to connect to. The `sync()` method is used to synchronize the array of QDac2 instruments. You can then perform various operations on the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies using the `qdac_array` object. Finally, you can close the connection using the `close()` method.
