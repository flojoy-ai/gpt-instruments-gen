```python

# Add the M5180 instrument to the station
station.add_component(m5180)

# Print the available parameters of the M5180 instrument
print(m5180.parameters)

# Set the start frequency to 1 GHz
m5180.start(1e9)

# Set the stop frequency to 10 GHz
m5180.stop(10e9)

# Set the number of points to 1001
m5180.npts(1001)

# Perform a frequency sweep and get the S11 magnitude and phase
s11_mag, s11_phase = m5180.s11()

# Print the S11 magnitude and phase
print("S11 Magnitude:", s11_mag)
print("S11 Phase:", s11_phase)

# Disconnect from the instruments

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your M5180 instrument.
