```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Create an instance of the HMP4040 power supply
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
hmp.connect()

# Perform operations with the power supply
# ...

# Disconnect from the power supply
hmp.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040` module.
2. Create an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class with a name and the IP address of the power supply.
3. Call the `connect()` method to establish a connection to the power supply.
4. Perform any desired operations with the power supply using the instance `hmp`.
5. Call the `disconnect()` method to close the connection to the power supply.
