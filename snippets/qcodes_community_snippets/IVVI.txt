Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to an IVVI IV Converter:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.ivvi import IVVI

# Create an instance of the IVVI instrument
ivvi = IVVI('ivvi', 'ASRL1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
ivvi.connect()

# Set the voltage of DAC 1 to 1000 mV
ivvi.dac1(1000)

# Get the voltage of DAC 1
voltage = ivvi.dac1()

# Print the voltage
print(f"Voltage of DAC 1: {voltage} mV")

# Disconnect from the instrument
ivvi.disconnect()
```

In this example, we first import the `IVVI` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.ivvi` module. We then create an instance of the `IVVI` instrument with a name and the address of the instrument (in this case, 'ASRL1::INSTR').

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. We can then use the `dac1()` method to set the voltage of DAC 1 to 1000 mV. We can also use the `dac1()` method without any arguments to get the voltage of DAC 1.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace 'ASRL1::INSTR' with the actual address of your IVVI IV Converter.
