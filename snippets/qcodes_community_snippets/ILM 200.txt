```python
from qcodes import create, VisaInstrument

# Create an instance of the ILM 200 Power Meter
ilm = create('ilm', 'OxfordInstruments_ILM200', address='ASRL4::INSTR')

# Get the helium level
level = ilm.level()

# Get the status of the device
status = ilm.status()

# Set the probe rate to fast
ilm.rate(1)

# Close the connection
ilm.close()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes.
2. Create an instance of the `OxfordInstruments_ILM200` class using the `create` function. Pass the instrument name as the first argument, the instrument class name as the second argument, and the instrument address as the `address` keyword argument.
3. Use the `level` method of the `ilm` object to get the helium level.
4. Use the `status` method of the `ilm` object to get the status of the device.
5. Use the `rate` method of the `ilm` object to set the probe rate to fast.
6. Use the `close` method of the `ilm` object to close the connection to the instrument.
