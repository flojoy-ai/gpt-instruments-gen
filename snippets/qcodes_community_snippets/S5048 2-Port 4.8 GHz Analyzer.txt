Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a S5048 2-Port 4.8 GHz Analyzer Network Analyzer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_P9374A import Keysight_P9374A

# Connect to the network analyzer
na = Keysight_P9374A('na', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(na.IDN())

# Set the start and stop frequency
na.start_frequency(1e9)  # 1 GHz
na.stop_frequency(4.8e9)  # 4.8 GHz

# Set the number of points and bandwidth
na.npts(1001)
na.bandwidth(1000)  # 1 kHz

# Perform a sweep and get the data
data = na.sweep()

# Print the data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the network analyzer
na.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your network analyzer.
