To connect to the SMW 200A simulation using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.SMW200A import SMW200A

# Create a mock visa handle
mock_handle = MockVisaHandle()

# Create a mock visa instrument
mock_instrument = MockVisa('mock_smw200a', address='GPIB::1::INSTR')
mock_instrument.set_address('GPIB::1::INSTR')

# Create a Qcodes instrument from the mock instrument
smw = SMW200A('smw200a', visa_handle=mock_handle)

# Connect to the instrument
smw.connect_message()

# Now you can use the SMW200A instrument as if it were a real instrument
# For example, you can get the frequency of the source
frequency = smw.source.frequency()
print(frequency)

# Close the connection to the instrument
smw.close()
```

Note that in the above script, we assume that you have already imported the necessary modules and classes.
