Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to an IP Power 9258 S Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.ip_power.ip9258 import IP9258

# Connect to the IP Power 9258 S Power Supply
power_supply = IP9258('power_supply', '192.168.1.100', 23)

# Turn on the power supply
power_supply.on()

# Set the voltage to 5V
power_supply.voltage(5)

# Set the current limit to 1A
power_supply.current(1)

# Turn off the power supply
power_supply.off()

# Close the connection
power_supply.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'192.168.1.100'` with the actual IP address of your IP Power 9258 S Power Supply.
