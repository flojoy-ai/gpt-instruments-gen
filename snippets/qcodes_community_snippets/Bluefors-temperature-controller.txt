To connect to a Bluefors temperature controller using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.BlueFors.BlueFors import BlueFors

# Create an instance of the BlueFors instrument
bluefors = BlueFors(name='bluefors',
                    folder_path='/path/to/log/folder',
                    channel_vacuum_can=1,
                    channel_pumping_line=2,
                    channel_compressor_outlet=3,
                    channel_compressor_inlet=4,
                    channel_mixture_tank=5,
                    channel_venting_line=6,
                    channel_50k_plate=7,
                    channel_4k_plate=8,
                    channel_still=9,
                    channel_mixing_chamber=10,
                    channel_magnet=11)

# Connect to the BlueFors instrument
bluefors.connect_message()

# Get the temperature of the 50K plate
temperature_50k_plate = bluefors.temperature_50k_plate()

# Get the pressure of the vacuum can
pressure_vacuum_can = bluefors.pressure_vacuum_can()

# Print the temperature and pressure values
print(f"Temperature of the 50K plate: {temperature_50k_plate} K")
print(f"Pressure of the vacuum can: {pressure_vacuum_can} mBar")

# Disconnect from the BlueFors instrument
bluefors.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/log/folder` with the actual path to the BlueFors log folder on your system. Also, adjust the channel numbers according to your specific setup.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the Qcodes Community package and its dependencies.
