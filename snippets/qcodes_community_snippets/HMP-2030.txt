```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Create an instance of the RohdeSchwarzHMP4040 driver
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
hmp.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
hmp.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP` module.
2. Create an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` driver with the desired name and address. Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR'` with the actual address of your HMP 2030 Power Supply.
3. Call the `connect()` method to establish a connection with the instrument.
4. Perform any desired operations using the instrument methods.
5. Call the `disconnect()` method to close the connection with the instrument.
