To connect to an M2j Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.base import Instrument
from qcodes.utils.validators import Numbers
import numpy as np

try:
    from spirack import M2j_module, SPI_rack
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError(('The M2j_module class could not be found. '
                       'Try installing it using pip install spirack'))


class M2j(Instrument):
    # The code for the M2j class is provided in the question


# Create an instance of the SPI_rack class
spi_rack = SPI_rack()

# Connect to the M2j Lockin Amplifier
m2j = M2j('m2j', spi_rack, module=1)

# Set the gain of the amplifier
m2j.gain(50)

# Get the RF level after amplification
rf_level = m2j.RF_level()
print(f"RF level: {rf_level} dBm")

# Clear RF clip
m2j.clear_rf_clip()

# Check if RF is clipped
is_rf_clipped = m2j.is_rf_clipped()
print(f"RF clipped: {is_rf_clipped}")
```

This script creates an instance of the `SPI_rack` class and then connects to the M2j Lockin Amplifier using the `M2j` class. It sets the gain of the amplifier to 50 dB, measures the RF level after amplification, clears the RF clip, and checks if the RF is clipped.
