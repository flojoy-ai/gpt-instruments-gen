To connect to a Singlequantum Photon Counting System using Qcodes Community, you can use the provided `WebSQControlqcode` class. Here's an example script that demonstrates how to connect to the instrument and perform some basic operations:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.singlequantum.WebSQControlqcode import WebSQControlqcode

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the Singlequantum Photon Counting System
instrument = WebSQControlqcode('singlequantum', address='localhost', port=12000)
station.add_component(instrument)

# Set the bias current to 100 uA
instrument.bias_current.set(100)

# Enable the detectors
instrument.detectors.set(True)

# Set the measurement period to 10 ms
instrument.measurement_periode.set(10)

# Acquire 5 points
instrument.npts.set(5)
counts = instrument.counters.get()

# Print the acquired counts
print(counts)

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.close()
```

In this script, we first create a `Station` object to hold the instrument. Then, we create an instance of the `WebSQControlqcode` class and add it to the station. We can then use the instrument's parameters to interact with the Singlequantum Photon Counting System. In this example, we set the bias current, enable the detectors, set the measurement period, and acquire counts for 5 points. Finally, we print the acquired counts and close the connection to the instrument.
