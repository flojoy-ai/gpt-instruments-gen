To connect to a Keithley 6430 Multimeter using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_6430 import Keithley_6430

# Create an instance of the Keithley_6430 driver
keithley = Keithley_6430('keithley', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
keithley.source_current(0.1)  # Set the source current to 0.1 A
voltage, current, resistance = keithley.read()  # Read the voltage, current, and resistance

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual address of your Keithley 6430 Multimeter.
