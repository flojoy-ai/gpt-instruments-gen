To connect to the SMR 40 RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.SMR40 import RohdeSchwarz_SMR40

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the SMR 40 RF Signal Generator
smr40 = RohdeSchwarz_SMR40('smr40', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(smr40)

# Now you can use the instrument
smr40.frequency.set(1e9)  # Set the frequency to 1 GHz
smr40.power.set(-10)  # Set the power to -10 dBm
smr40.on()  # Turn on the signal generator

# Close the connection
smr40.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your SMR 40 RF Signal Generator.
