To connect to a Qdac 1 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QDevil.QDac import QDac

# Create an instance of the QDac instrument
qdac = QDac('qdac', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the IDN of the instrument
print(qdac.IDN())

# Set the voltage of channel 1 to 1V
qdac.channels.ch01.v(1)

# Get the voltage of channel 1
voltage = qdac.channels.ch01.v()
print(f"Voltage of channel 1: {voltage} V")

# Ramp the voltage of channel 1 from 0V to 1V in 1 second
qdac.ramp_voltages([1], [0], [1], 1)
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your Qdac 1 Power Supply.
