Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-102 digital attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-102 digital attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=55102, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Note: Replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the directory that contains the Vaunix LDA DLLs (`VNX_atten64.dll` for 64-bit Windows or `VNX_atten.dll` for 32-bit Windows).

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-102 digital attenuator using the `LDA` driver from the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package. The `serial_number` argument is set to the serial number of the LDA-102 device. The `dll_path` argument is set to the path of the directory that contains the Vaunix LDA DLLs.

The LDA is added to the station using the `add_component` method. The IDN of the LDA is printed using the `get_idn` method. The attenuation is set to 10 dB using the `attenuation` parameter. Finally, the connection to the LDA is closed using the `close` method.
