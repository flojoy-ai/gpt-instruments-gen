To connect to the SMW 200 A RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.SMWSMU import SMWSMU

# Create an instance of the SMWSMU driver
smw = SMWSMU('smw', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
smw.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the output power
smw.output_power(0)  # Set the output power to 0 dBm

# Disconnect from the instrument
smw.disconnect()
```

This code creates an instance of the `SMWSMU` driver and connects to the SMW 200 A RF Signal Generator using the specified VISA address. You can then use the various methods provided by the driver to control the instrument, such as setting the output power.

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your instrument.
