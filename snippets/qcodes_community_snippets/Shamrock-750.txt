To connect to a Shamrock 750 spectrometer using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.shamrock.shamrock import Shamrock_SR750

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Create an instance of the Shamrock_SR750 instrument
shamrock = Shamrock_SR750('shamrock', dll_path='C:\\Program Files\\Andor SDK\\Shamrock64\\ShamrockCIF.dll', device_id=0)

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(shamrock)

# Connect to the instrument
shamrock.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument methods to control the spectrometer
# For example, to get the current grating:
grating = shamrock.grating()

# To set the grating to a specific value:
shamrock.grating(2)

# To get the wavelength:
wavelength = shamrock.wavelength()

# To set the wavelength:
shamrock.wavelength(500)

# Disconnect from the instrument
shamrock.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to provide the correct `dll_path` for the ShamrockCIF.dll file. Also, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `qcodes` and `pywin32`.
