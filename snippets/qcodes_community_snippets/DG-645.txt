To connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import create_instrument

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = create_instrument('DG645', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Now you can use the instrument object 'dg645' to control the pulse generator
# For example, you can set the trigger rate
dg645.trigger_rate(1000)  # Set the trigger rate to 1000 Hz

# You can also read the current trigger source
trigger_source = dg645.trigger_source()
print(f"Current trigger source: {trigger_source}")

# Close the connection to the instrument
dg645.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your DG645 Pulse Generator.
