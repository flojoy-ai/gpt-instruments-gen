Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-602E Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-602E Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=602, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA instrument
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA instrument
lda.close()
```

Note: Replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the directory that contains the Vaunix LDA DLL (`VNX_atten64.dll` or `VNX_atten.dll`).
