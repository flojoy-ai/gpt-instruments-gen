To connect to a LDA-802EH using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Create an instance of the LDA driver
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=802, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Connect to the LDA instrument
lda.connect()

# Now you can use the LDA instrument to control the attenuator
# For example, to set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1:
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Disconnect from the LDA instrument
lda.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL files for the LDA instrument.
