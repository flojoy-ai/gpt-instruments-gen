To connect to a PRM1Z8 Motion using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs import Thorlabs_APT, Thorlabs_PRM1Z8

# Create a Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the PRM1Z8 polarizer wheel
prm1z8 = Thorlabs_PRM1Z8('prm1z8', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the instrument
station = Station()
station.add_component(prm1z8)

# Connect to the instrument
station.connect(prm1z8)

# Now you can use the instrument
position = prm1z8.position()
print(f"Current position: {position} degrees")

# Set the position to 45 degrees
prm1z8.position(45)
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules from Qcodes. Then, we create a Thorlabs_APT object to serve as the APT server. Next, we create an instance of the Thorlabs_PRM1Z8 instrument, providing the instrument name, device ID, and the APT server object.

We then create a Station object and add the PRM1Z8 instrument to it. Finally, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method of the Station object.

After connecting, we can use the instrument's methods and parameters. In this example, we retrieve the current position using the `position()` method and print it. Then, we set the position to 45 degrees using the `position()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Qcodes and the Thorlabs APT Python package.
