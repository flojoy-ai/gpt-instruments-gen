To connect to a PRM1Z8 Motion using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Thorlabs.PRM1Z8 import Thorlabs_PRM1Z8
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Thorlabs.APT import Thorlabs_APT

# Create an instance of the Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the PRM1Z8 polarizer wheel
prm1z8 = Thorlabs_PRM1Z8('prm1z8', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the instrument
station = Station()
station.add_component(prm1z8)

# Connect to the instrument
station.connect(prm1z8)

# Now you can use the instrument
position = prm1z8.position()
print(f"Current position: {position} degrees")

# Set the position to 45 degrees
prm1z8.position(45)
```

Note that you need to have the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package installed to use the `Thorlabs_PRM1Z8` and `Thorlabs_APT` classes.
