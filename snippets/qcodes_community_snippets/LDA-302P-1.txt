Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-302P-1 Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-302P-1 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=302, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the instrument's IDN
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA instrument.
