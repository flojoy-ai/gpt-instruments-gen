To connect to a LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=80232)

# Add the attenuator to the station
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the IDN of the attenuator
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
attenuator.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the attenuator
attenuator.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator using the `LDA` driver from the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package. The attenuator is added to the station, and its IDN is printed. The attenuation is set to 10 dB, and finally, the connection to the attenuator is closed.
