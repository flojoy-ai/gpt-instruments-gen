To connect to a LDA-802-32 using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-32
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=80232)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-802-32 by creating an instance of the `LDA` class with the appropriate serial number. The LDA is added to the station using the `add_component` method. The IDN of the LDA is printed using the `get_idn` method. The attenuation on channel 1 is set to 10 dB using the `attenuation` parameter. Finally, the connection to the LDA is closed using the `close` method.
