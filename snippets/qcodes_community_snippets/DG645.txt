Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.DG645 import DG645

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = DG645('dg645', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')
station.add_component(dg645)

# Print the available parameters of the DG645
print(dg645.parameters)

# Set the trigger level to 0.5V
dg645.trigger_level(0.5)

# Set the trigger rate to 1kHz
dg645.trigger_rate(1000)

# Set the trigger source to external rising edge
dg645.trigger_source('ext_rising')

# Set the burst count to 10
dg645.burst_count(10)

# Set the burst delay to 1ms
dg645.burst_delay(0.001)

# Set the burst period to 1s
dg645.burst_period(1)

# Set the burst T0 configuration to 1
dg645.burst_T0_config(1)

# Set the delay of channel A relative to channel T0 to 1ms
dg645.delay_A('2,+0.001')

# Set the delay of channel B relative to channel T0 to 2ms
dg645.delay_B('2,+0.002')

# Set the amplitude of output T0 to 1V
dg645.amp_out_T0(1)

# Set the offset of output T0 to 0V
dg645.offset_out_T0(0)

# Set the polarity of output T0 to positive
dg645.polarity_out_T0(1)

# Trigger the pulse generator
dg645.trigger()

# Close the connection to the instruments
station.close_all()
```

This script connects to a DG645 Pulse Generator using its IP address and sets various parameters such as trigger level, trigger rate, trigger source, burst count, burst delay, burst period, burst T0 configuration, channel delays, output amplitudes, output offsets, and output polarities. Finally, it triggers the pulse generator and closes the connection to the instruments.
