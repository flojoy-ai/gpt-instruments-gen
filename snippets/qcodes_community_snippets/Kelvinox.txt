Sure! Here's an example of a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a Kelvinox:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.qcodes_contrib_drivers.Kelvinox import Kelvinox_ICE

# Connect to the Kelvinox
kelvinox = Kelvinox_ICE("kelvinox", "ASRL1::INSTR")

# Print the instrument ID
print(kelvinox.IDN())

# Set the temperature
kelvinox.temperature(1.5)

# Close the connection
kelvinox.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and the `Kelvinox_ICE` driver from `qcodes_contrib_drivers`. 

Then, we create an instance of the `Kelvinox_ICE` driver, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string `"ASRL1::INSTR"` is just an example and should be replaced with the appropriate connection string for your specific setup.

We can then use the various methods provided by the `Kelvinox_ICE` driver to interact with the instrument. In this example, we print the instrument ID using the `IDN()` method and set the temperature to 1.5 Kelvin using the `temperature()` method.

Finally, we close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.

Note that this is just a basic example to demonstrate the usage of Qcodes Community with a Kelvinox. You may need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and instrument capabilities.
