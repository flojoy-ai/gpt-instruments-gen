To connect to a LDA-802-16 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-16 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=80216)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-802-16 Digital Attenuator using the `LDA` driver from the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package. The LDA is added to the station and its IDN is printed. The attenuation on channel 1 is set to 10 dB, and finally, the connection to the LDA is closed.
