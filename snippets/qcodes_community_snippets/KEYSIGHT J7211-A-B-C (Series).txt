To connect to a KEYSIGHT J7211/A/B/C Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.utils.validators import Ints
from typing import Optional


class Keysight_J7211(VisaInstrument):
    r"""
    Qcodes driver for the Keysight J7211 Attenuation Control Unit.
    Tested with J7211B.

    Args:
        name: Instrument name
        address: Address or VISA alias of instrument
        attenuation: Optional attenuation level (in dB) to set on startup
        terminator: Termination character in VISA communication.
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, address: str,
                 attenuation: Optional[int] = None,
                 terminator="\r", **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name=name, address=address,
                         terminator=terminator, **kwargs)

        model = self.IDN()['model']
        if model in ["J7211A", "J7211B"]:
            vals = Ints(0, 120)
        elif model in ["J7211C"]:
            vals = Ints(0, 100)
        else:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Model {model} is not supported.")

        self.add_parameter('attenuation', unit='dB',
                           set_cmd='ATT {:03.0f}',
                           get_cmd='ATT?',
                           get_parser=int,
                           vals=vals,
                           initial_value=attenuation)

        self.connect_message()
```

This script defines a class `Keysight_J7211` that inherits from `VisaInstrument` in the `qcodes.instrument.visa` module. The class represents the KEYSIGHT J7211 Attenuation Control Unit.

To use this class, you need to create an instance of it by providing the necessary arguments:

- `name`: The name of the instrument.
- `address`: The address or VISA alias of the instrument.
- `attenuation`: Optional attenuation level (in dB) to set on startup.
- `terminator`: The termination character in VISA communication.

Once you have created an instance of `Keysight_J7211`, you can access and control the instrument using its parameters. In this case, the only parameter defined is `attenuation`, which represents the attenuation level in dB. You can set and get the attenuation level using the `set_cmd` and `get_cmd` commands respectively. The `vals` argument specifies the valid range of attenuation values.

To connect to the instrument, you can call the `connect_message()` method.

Note: This code is a template for creating a driver for the KEYSIGHT J7211 Attenuation Control Unit. You may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the communication protocol of your instrument.
