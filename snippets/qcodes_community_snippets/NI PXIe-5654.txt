To connect to a NI PXIe-5654 RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.NationalInstruments.NI_PXIe_5654 import NI_PXIe_5654

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = NI_PXIe_5654('signal_generator', 'PXI1Slot2')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
frequency = 1e6  # Set the frequency to 1 MHz
signal_generator.frequency(frequency)

power_level = 0  # Set the power level to 0 dBm
signal_generator.power_level(power_level)

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

Make sure you have installed the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package, which contains the `NI_PXIe_5654` driver. You can install it using `pip install qcodes_contrib_drivers`.

Replace `'PXI1Slot2'` with the appropriate resource name for your specific setup.

The script creates an instance of the `NI_PXIe_5654` driver, connects to the instrument, sets the frequency and power level, and then disconnects from the instrument.
