To connect to a LDA-802-8 using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-8
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=8028)
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. Then, it connects to the LDA-802-8 by creating an instance of the `LDA` driver and adding it to the station. The `serial_number` argument is set to `8028` to specify the specific LDA device to connect to.

After connecting, you can use the `get_idn()` method to print the identification information of the LDA.

You can then use the `attenuation()` method to set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1 of the LDA.

Finally, the `close()` method is called to close the connection to the LDA.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary DLL files (`VNX_atten64.dll` or `VNX_atten.dll`) in the correct directory as specified in the script.
