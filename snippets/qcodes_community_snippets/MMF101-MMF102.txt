To connect to a Thorlabs MFF101 or MFF102 mirror flipper using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs import Thorlabs_APT
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs.MFF10x import Thorlabs_MFF10x

# Create a Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the mirror flipper
mff = Thorlabs_MFF10x('mff', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the mirror flipper
station = Station()
station.add_component(mff)

# Print the IDN of the mirror flipper
print(mff.get_idn())

# Close the connection
mff.close()
apt.close()
```

This script creates a Thorlabs APT server and connects to the mirror flipper with the specified device ID (1 in this example). It then creates a station and adds the mirror flipper as a component. Finally, it prints the IDN (identification) of the mirror flipper and closes the connection.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`qcodes`, `ThorlabsAPT`, and `Thorlabs.MotionControl`).
