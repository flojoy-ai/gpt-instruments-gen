To connect to a Thorlabs MFF101 or MFF102 mirror flipper using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs import Thorlabs_APT
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs.MFF10x import Thorlabs_MFF10x

# Create a Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the mirror flipper
mff = Thorlabs_MFF10x('mff', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the mirror flipper
station = Station()
station.add_component(mff)

# Connect to the mirror flipper
mff.connect()

# Now you can use the mirror flipper
print(mff.position())

# Disconnect from the mirror flipper
mff.disconnect()
```

This script creates a Thorlabs APT server and connects to the mirror flipper using the `Thorlabs_MFF10x` instrument driver. It then adds the mirror flipper to a station and connects to it. Finally, it retrieves the current position of the mirror flipper and disconnects from it.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `qcodes` and the Thorlabs APT software.
