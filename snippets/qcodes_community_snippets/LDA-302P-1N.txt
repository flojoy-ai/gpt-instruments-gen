Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-302P-1N Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-302P-1N Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=12345678)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Note: Replace `12345678` with the actual serial number of your LDA-302P-1N Digital Attenuator.
