```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N9000A import Keysight_N9000A

# Connect to the spectrum analyzer
sa = Keysight_N9000A('sa', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(sa.IDN())

# Close the connection
sa.close()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and `Keysight_N9000A` from `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N9000A`.
2. Create an instance of the `Keysight_N9000A` class and pass the instrument name ('sa') and the instrument address ('TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR') as arguments.
3. Use the `IDN()` method to get the instrument identification string and print it.
4. Close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.
