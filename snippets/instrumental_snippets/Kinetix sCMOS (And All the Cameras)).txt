Sure! Here's an example script that uses the Instrumental library to connect to a Kinetix sCMOS camera:

```python
import instrumental as ins

# Connect to the camera
camera = ins.KinetixCamera()

# Set the exposure time
camera.exposure_time = 0.1

# Start acquiring frames
camera.start_acquisition()

# Capture a single frame
frame = camera.capture_frame()

# Stop acquiring frames
camera.stop_acquisition()

# Disconnect from the camera
camera.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `KinetixCamera` class from the Instrumental library. It then sets the exposure time to 0.1 seconds and starts acquiring frames. It captures a single frame and then stops acquiring frames. Finally, it disconnects from the camera.

Note that you may need to install the Instrumental library using `pip install instrumental` before running this script.
