Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses the Instrumental library to connect to a KEYSIGHT 86100A Oscilloscope:

```python
import instrumental

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = instrumental.instrument('keysight_86100a', address='GPIB0::9::INSTR')

# Set the oscilloscope to acquire data
oscilloscope.write('ACQUIRE:MODE SAMPLE')

# Configure the oscilloscope to measure the eye diagram
oscilloscope.write('MEASURE:EYE')

# Trigger the oscilloscope to start acquiring data
oscilloscope.write('TRIGGER')

# Read the acquired data from the oscilloscope
data = oscilloscope.query('FETCH:EYE')

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.disconnect()
```

This script uses the `instrumental` library to connect to the KEYSIGHT 86100A Oscilloscope using the GPIB interface. It sets the oscilloscope to acquire data in sample mode and configures it to measure the eye diagram. Then, it triggers the oscilloscope to start acquiring data and reads the acquired data using the `FETCH:EYE` command. Finally, it prints the acquired data and disconnects from the oscilloscope.

Note: Make sure you have the `instrumental` library installed before running this script. You can install it using `pip install instrumental`.
