To use Instrumental to connect to a CC126Mu camera, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# Find available instruments
instruments = list_instruments()
print("Available instruments:", instruments)

# Connect to the CC126Mu camera
camera = instrument(instruments[0])

# Set exposure time
camera.set_exposure_time(0.1)  # Set exposure time to 0.1 seconds

# Start image acquisition
camera.start_acquisition()

# Wait for image to be acquired
time.sleep(1)

# Get the acquired image
image = camera.get_image()

# Display the image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()

# Stop image acquisition
camera.stop_acquisition()

# Disconnect from the camera
camera.close()
```

This script first lists the available instruments using the `list_instruments()` function from Instrumental. It then connects to the first instrument in the list using the `instrument()` function. The `set_exposure_time()` function is used to set the exposure time of the camera. The `start_acquisition()` function starts the image acquisition process, and the `get_image()` function is used to retrieve the acquired image. Finally, the acquired image is displayed using matplotlib, and the `stop_acquisition()` function is called to stop the image acquisition process. The `close()` function is used to disconnect from the camera.
