To connect to a Thorlabs DCU224C camera using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available instruments
print(list_instruments())

# Connect to the Thorlabs DCU224C camera
cam = instrument('Thorlabs DCU224C')

# Perform operations on the camera
# For example, capture an image
image = cam.grab_image()

# Close the camera connection
cam.close()
```

This script first lists all available instruments using the `list_instruments()` function from Instrumental. Then, it connects to the Thorlabs DCU224C camera using the `instrument()` function and assigns it to the `cam` variable. You can then perform operations on the camera, such as capturing an image using the `grab_image()` method. Finally, the camera connection is closed using the `close()` method.

Note that you may need to install the `instrumental` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumental
```

Make sure you have the necessary drivers and dependencies installed for the Thorlabs DCU224C camera to work properly.
