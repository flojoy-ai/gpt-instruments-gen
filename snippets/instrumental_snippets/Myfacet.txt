Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses the Instrumental library to connect to a Myfacet Power Meter:

```python
import instrumental

# Create a connection to the Myfacet Power Meter
power_meter = instrumental.instrument('myfacet_power_meter')

# Connect to the power meter
power_meter.connect()

# Read the power value from the power meter
power_value = power_meter.read()

# Print the power value
print("Power value:", power_value)

# Disconnect from the power meter
power_meter.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `instrumental` module. Then, we create a connection to the Myfacet Power Meter using the `instrument` function, passing in the name of the power meter as an argument.

Next, we connect to the power meter using the `connect` method. This establishes a connection to the power meter.

We then read the power value from the power meter using the `read` method and store it in the `power_value` variable.

Finally, we print the power value and disconnect from the power meter using the `disconnect` method.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumental` library and have the necessary drivers and dependencies set up for the Myfacet Power Meter.
