Here is a Python script that uses Instrumental to connect to a PM100D Power Meter:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available instruments
print(list_instruments())

# Connect to the PM100D Power Meter
pm100d = instrument('Thorlabs PM100D')

# Get the current power reading
power = pm100d.power()
print('Current power:', power)

# Set the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm
pm100d.wavelength = 1550

# Get the input signal wavelength
wavelength = pm100d.wavelength
print('Current wavelength:', wavelength)

# Make a multi-sample power measurement
measurement = pm100d.measure(n_samples=10)
print('Average power:', measurement.nominal_value)
print('Power uncertainty:', measurement.std_dev)

# Close the connection to the Power Meter
pm100d.close()
```

This script first lists all available instruments using the `list_instruments()` function. Then, it connects to the PM100D Power Meter using the `instrument()` function and assigns it to the `pm100d` variable.

The script then demonstrates some basic operations with the Power Meter. It retrieves the current power reading using the `power()` method and prints it. It sets the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm using the `wavelength` attribute. It retrieves the current wavelength using the `wavelength` attribute and prints it.

Finally, the script makes a multi-sample power measurement using the `measure()` method with 10 samples. It retrieves the average power and power uncertainty from the measurement and prints them.

The script closes the connection to the Power Meter using the `close()` method.
