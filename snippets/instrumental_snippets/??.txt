To connect to a Rigol oscilloscope using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumental

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope = instrumental.RigolScope()

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
scope.beeper = True
time, volts = scope.get_data()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

This script uses the `instrumental` library to connect to a Rigol oscilloscope. It creates an instance of the `RigolScope` class, which is a subclass of `Scope` and `VisaMixin`. The `RigolScope` class provides methods and properties to interact with the oscilloscope.

In the script, you can perform various operations on the oscilloscope, such as enabling the beeper (`scope.beeper = True`) and getting waveform data (`time, volts = scope.get_data()`). Finally, you can disconnect from the oscilloscope using `scope.disconnect()`.
