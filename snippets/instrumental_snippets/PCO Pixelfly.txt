To connect to a PCO Pixelfly camera using Instrumental, you can use the following code:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available PCO Pixelfly cameras
cameras = list_instruments('Pixelfly')

# Connect to the first camera
camera = instrument(cameras[0])

# Perform camera operations
# ...

# Close the camera connection
camera.close()
```

This code uses the `instrumental` library to list all available PCO Pixelfly cameras using the `list_instruments` function. It then connects to the first camera in the list using the `instrument` function. You can perform camera operations using the `camera` object, and finally, close the camera connection using the `close` method.
