Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses the Instrumental library to connect to a Pi Camera:

```python
import instrumental

# Connect to the Pi Camera
camera = instrumental.PiCamera()

# Start the camera preview
camera.start_preview()

# Capture an image
camera.capture('image.jpg')

# Start recording video
camera.start_recording('video.h264')

# Wait for 10 seconds
camera.wait_recording(10)

# Stop recording video
camera.stop_recording()

# Stop the camera preview
camera.stop_preview()

# Close the camera connection
camera.close()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to the Pi Camera, start the camera preview, capture an image, start recording video, wait for a specified duration, stop recording video, stop the camera preview, and close the camera connection.

Note that you will need to have the Instrumental library installed in order to run this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumental
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the Pi Camera before running this script.
