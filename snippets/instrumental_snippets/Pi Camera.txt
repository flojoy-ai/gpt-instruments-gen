To use Instrumental to connect to a Pi Camera, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments
```

2. List the available instruments:
```python
instruments = list_instruments()
print(instruments)
```

3. Connect to a Pi Camera:
```python
camera = instrument(instruments[0])
```

4. Use the camera to capture an image:
```python
image = camera.grab_image()
```

5. Display the captured image:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `picamera`.
