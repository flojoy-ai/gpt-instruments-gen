Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumental to connect to a Thorlabs TDC001 Motion controller:

```python
import instrumental

# Connect to the TDC001 Motion controller
controller = instrumental.instrument('tdc001')

# Enable the controller
controller.enable()

# Move the motor to a specific position
controller.move_to_position(100)

# Disable the controller
controller.disable()

# Disconnect from the controller
controller.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `instrumental` module. Then, we create an instance of the `instrument` class, specifying the instrument type as `'tdc001'` to connect to the Thorlabs TDC001 Motion controller.

We then enable the controller using the `enable()` method, move the motor to a specific position using the `move_to_position()` method (in this example, we move it to position 100), disable the controller using the `disable()` method, and finally disconnect from the controller using the `disconnect()` method.

Note that you may need to install the `instrumental` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instrumental
```

Make sure you have the necessary drivers and libraries installed for the Thorlabs TDC001 Motion controller as well.
