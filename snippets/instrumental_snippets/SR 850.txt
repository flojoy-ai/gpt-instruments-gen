Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumental to connect to a SR 850 Lock-in Amplifier:

```python
import instrumental

# Connect to the SR 850 Lock-in Amplifier
sr850 = instrumental.SR850()

# Set the reference frequency to 1 kHz
sr850.set_reference_frequency(1e3)

# Get the reference frequency
ref_freq = sr850.get_reference_frequency()
print("Reference Frequency:", ref_freq)

# Set the sensitivity to 10 nV/fA
sr850.set_sensitivity(sr850.Sensitivity.x10nV_fA)

# Get the sensitivity
sensitivity = sr850.get_sensitivity()
print("Sensitivity:", sensitivity)

# Close the connection
sr850.close()
```

This script connects to the SR 850 Lock-in Amplifier, sets the reference frequency to 1 kHz, gets the reference frequency, sets the sensitivity to 10 nV/fA, gets the sensitivity, and then closes the connection.
