To connect to a Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# Find the Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion instrument
instruments = list_instruments()
newmark_instrument = None
for instrument in instruments:
    if 'Newmark-NSC-A1' in instrument:
        newmark_instrument = instrument
        break

# Connect to the Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion instrument
if newmark_instrument:
    motion = instrument(newmark_instrument)
    print("Connected to Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion")
    
    # Get the current angle of the stage
    angle = motion.angle
    print(f"Current angle: {angle}")

    # Rotate the stage clockwise by 90 degrees
    motion.cw(90)

    # Set the velocity of the stage to 10 degrees per second
    motion.velocity = 10

    # Disconnect from the motion controller
    motion.close()
else:
    print("Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion not found")
```

This script first imports the necessary functions from the `instrumental` module. It then uses the `list_instruments()` function to get a list of available instruments. It searches for an instrument with the name containing "Newmark-NSC-A1" and assigns it to the `newmark_instrument` variable.

If a Newmark-NSC-A1 Motion instrument is found, it uses the `instrument()` function to connect to the instrument and assigns it to the `motion` variable. Finally, it prints a message indicating whether the connection was successful or not.

Note: The script assumes that you have already installed the `instrumental` package.
