To connect to a Smaract MCS2 Motion controller using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# Find the available instruments
instruments = list_instruments()

# Connect to the Smaract MCS2 Motion controller
controller = instrument(instruments[0])

# Now you can use the controller object to send commands and retrieve information
# For example, to get the version of the controller:
version = controller.version
print(version)

# To get the number of channels:
nchannels = controller.nchannels
print(nchannels)

# To reset the controller:
controller.reset()

# To set the sensor enabled mode:
controller.sensor_enabled = 1

# To trigger a command:
controller.trigger_command()

# To configure the baudrate:
controller.configure_baudrate(9600)

# To keep the controller alive:
controller.keep_alive(1000)

# Disconnect from the controller
controller.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `instruments[0]` with the appropriate instrument name or address for your specific setup.
