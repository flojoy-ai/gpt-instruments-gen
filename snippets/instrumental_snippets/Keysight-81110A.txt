To connect to a Keysight 81110A Function Generator using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_resources

# Find available resources
resources = list_resources()

# Connect to the Keysight 81110A Function Generator
func_gen = instrument(resources[0])

# Now you can use the function generator
# For example, to set the frequency:
func_gen.frequency = 1000  # Set frequency to 1 kHz

# Close the connection
func_gen.close()
```

This script first uses the `list_resources()` function from Instrumental to find all available resources. It then connects to the first resource found, assuming it is the Keysight 81110A Function Generator. You can modify the index `0` in `resources[0]` to connect to a different resource if needed.

Once connected, you can use the `func_gen` object to control the function generator. In the example above, it sets the frequency to 1 kHz by assigning the desired frequency to the `frequency` attribute of the `func_gen` object.

Finally, the `close()` method is called to close the connection to the function generator.
