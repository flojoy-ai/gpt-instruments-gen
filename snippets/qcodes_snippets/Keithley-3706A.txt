To connect to a Keithley 3706A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_3706A import Keithley3706A

# Create an instance of the Keithley3706A instrument
keithley = Keithley3706A("keithley", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect_message()

# Perform operations with the instrument
keithley.reset_channel("allslots")
keithley.open_channel("slot1")
keithley.close_channel("slot2")

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and create an instance of the `Keithley3706A` instrument. We provide the instrument name and the VISA resource address (in this case, the IP address of the instrument). Then, we connect to the instrument using the `connect_message()` method, which prints information about the connected instrument and its switch cards. Finally, we can perform operations with the instrument, such as resetting channels, opening channels, and closing channels. After we are done, we disconnect from the instrument using the `close()` method.
