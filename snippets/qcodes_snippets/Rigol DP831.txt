```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DP831 import RigolDP831

# Create an instance of the RigolDP831 driver
dp831 = RigolDP831('dp831', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.10::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
dp831.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
dp831.disconnect()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `RigolDP831` driver. It then connects to the instrument using the specified address. After connecting, you can perform various operations with the instrument. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
