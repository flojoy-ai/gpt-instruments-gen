Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an Ithaco 1211 Lockin Amplifier:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.ithaco import Ithaco1211

# Connect to the Ithaco 1211 Lockin Amplifier
lockin = Ithaco1211('lockin', 'COM1')  # Replace 'COM1' with the actual serial port of the lockin

# Print the lockin amplifier's IDN
print(lockin.IDN())

# Set the lockin amplifier's frequency to 1 kHz
lockin.frequency(1000)

# Set the lockin amplifier's amplitude to 0.1 V
lockin.amplitude(0.1)

# Enable the lockin amplifier's output
lockin.output_enable(True)

# Disable the lockin amplifier's output
lockin.output_enable(False)

# Close the connection to the lockin amplifier
lockin.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. We then create an instance of the `Ithaco1211` class, passing the instrument name and the serial port to which the lockin amplifier is connected. You should replace `'COM1'` with the actual serial port of your lockin amplifier.

We can then use various methods of the `Ithaco1211` class to interact with the lockin amplifier. For example, we can use the `frequency()` method to set the lockin amplifier's frequency, the `amplitude()` method to set the lockin amplifier's amplitude, and the `output_enable()` method to enable or disable the lockin amplifier's output.

Finally, we close the connection to the lockin amplifier using the `close()` method.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed Qcodes and the necessary dependencies.
