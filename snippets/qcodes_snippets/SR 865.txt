Sure! Here's a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a SR 865 lock-in amplifier:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR865 import SR865

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
lockin = SR865('lockin', 'GPIB0::1::INSTR')

# Print the identification string of the lock-in amplifier
print(lockin.IDN())

# Close the connection to the lock-in amplifier
lockin.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. We then create an instance of the `SR865` class, which represents the SR 865 lock-in amplifier. The first argument to the `SR865` constructor is the name of the instrument, and the second argument is the address of the instrument (in this case, the GPIB address).

We can then use the `lockin` object to interact with the lock-in amplifier. In this example, we simply print the identification string of the lock-in amplifier using the `IDN()` method.

Finally, we close the connection to the lock-in amplifier using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `qcodes` and `pyvisa`, before running this script.
