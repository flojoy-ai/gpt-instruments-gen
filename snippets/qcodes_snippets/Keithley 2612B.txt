To connect to a Keithley 2612B Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2600

# Create an instance of the Keithley2612B driver
keithley = Keithley2600('keithley', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `Keithley2600` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600` module. Then, we create an instance of the `Keithley2600` driver, passing a name for the instrument and the connection string as arguments to the constructor.

The connection string `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` should be replaced with the appropriate connection details for your specific instrument. You may need to modify the IP address or other parameters depending on your setup.

After creating the instrument instance, we can call the `connect()` method to establish a connection to the instrument. Once connected, you can perform various operations with the instrument.

Finally, we call the `disconnect()` method to close the connection to the instrument.
