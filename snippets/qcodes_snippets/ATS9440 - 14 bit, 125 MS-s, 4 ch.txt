Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9440 - 14 bit, 125 MS/s, 4 ch DAQ board:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9440 import AlazarTech_ATS9440

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Create an instance of the ATS9440 instrument
ats9440 = AlazarTech_ATS9440('ats9440', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(ats9440)

# Connect to the instrument
ats9440.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform measurements
# For example, you can set the clock source:
ats9440.clock_source('INTERNAL_CLOCK')

# You can also read the current clock source:
clock_source = ats9440.clock_source()

# Disconnect from the instrument
ats9440.disconnect()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll'` with the correct path to the ATSApi.dll file on your system.
