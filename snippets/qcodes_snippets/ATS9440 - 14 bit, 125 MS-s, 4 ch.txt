To connect to an ATS9440 board using Qcodes, you can use the `AlazarTech_ATS` driver provided by Qcodes. Here's an example script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9440 import AlazarTech_ATS9440

# Connect to the ATS9440 board
board = AlazarTech_ATS9440("board", system_id=1, board_id=1)

# Print the board information
print(board.get_idn())

# Configure the board settings
board.clock_source('INTERNAL_CLOCK')
board.sample_rate(125e6)
board.clock_edge('CLOCK_EDGE_RISING')
board.decimation(1)
board.coupling1('DC')
board.coupling2('DC')
board.coupling3('DC')
board.coupling4('DC')
board.channel_range1(0.4)
board.channel_range2(0.4)
board.channel_range3(0.4)
board.channel_range4(0.4)

# Perform an acquisition
board.acquire(1, 1024, mode='NPT', records_per_buffer=10, buffers_per_acquisition=1)

# Read the acquired data
data = board.readout_data()

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the board
board.close()
```

Note: Make sure you have Qcodes and the AlazarTech ATS driver installed before running this script.
