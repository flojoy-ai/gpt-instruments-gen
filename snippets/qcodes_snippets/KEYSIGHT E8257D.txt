Sure! Here's an example script that uses Qcodes to connect to a KEYSIGHT E8257D RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_E8257D import Keysight_E8257D

# Connect to the RF Signal Generator
rf_generator = Keysight_E8257D('rf_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Set the frequency and power level
rf_generator.frequency(1e9)  # Set frequency to 1 GHz
rf_generator.power(-10)  # Set power level to -10 dBm

# Enable the RF output
rf_generator.rf_output(True)

# Disconnect from the RF Signal Generator
rf_generator.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your RF Signal Generator.
