To connect to a Rigol DS4000-Series Oscilloscope using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DS4000 import RigolDS4000

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = RigolDS4000("oscilloscope", "USB0::0x1AB1::0x04CE::DS4A203100839::INSTR")

# Print the IDN information of the oscilloscope
print(oscilloscope.get_idn())

# Set the time base to 1 ms/div
oscilloscope.time_base(0.001)

# Enable autoscale
oscilloscope.enable_auto_scale(True)

# Start acquisition
oscilloscope.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
qc.WaitInterval(1).wait()

# Stop acquisition
oscilloscope.stop()

# Get the waveform data from channel 1
waveform_data = oscilloscope.channels.ch1.curvedata()

# Print the waveform data
print(waveform_data)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the VISA address "USB0::0x1AB1::0x04CE::DS4A203100839::INSTR". You may need to modify this address to match the actual address of your oscilloscope.

The script then performs various operations on the oscilloscope, such as setting the time base, enabling autoscale, starting and stopping the acquisition, and retrieving the waveform data from channel 1.

Finally, the script closes the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close()` method.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, including Qcodes and the Rigol DS4000 driver.
