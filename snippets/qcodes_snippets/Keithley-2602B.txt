To connect to a Keithley 2602B Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2602B

# Create an instance of the Keithley2602B instrument
keithley = Keithley2602B('keithley', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `Keithley2602B` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600` module. We then create an instance of the `Keithley2602B` instrument, providing a name for the instrument ('keithley') and the connection string ('TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR').

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. You can perform various operations with the instrument, such as setting voltage or current, measuring voltage or current, etc.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
