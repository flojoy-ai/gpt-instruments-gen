```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DP8xx import RigolDP832

# Create an instance of the RigolDP832 driver
dp832 = RigolDP832('dp832', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.10::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
dp832.connect()

# Perform operations using the instrument
# ...

# Disconnect from the instrument
dp832.disconnect()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `RigolDP832` driver. It then connects to the instrument using the specified IP address. You can perform various operations using the `dp832` object, and finally disconnect from the instrument.
