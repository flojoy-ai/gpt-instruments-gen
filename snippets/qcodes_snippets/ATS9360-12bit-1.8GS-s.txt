Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9360-12bit, 1.8GS/s DAQ board:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9360 import AlazarTech_ATS9360

# Connect to the ATS9360 DAQ board
daq = AlazarTech_ATS9360("daq", "ATS9360")

# Configure the DAQ board settings
daq.clock_source("INTERNAL_CLOCK")
daq.sample_rate(1.8e9)
daq.clock_edge("CLOCK_EDGE_RISING")
daq.decimation(1)
daq.coupling1("DC")
daq.coupling2("DC")
daq.channel_range1(0.4)
daq.channel_range2(0.4)
daq.trigger_operation("TRIG_ENGINE_OP_J")
daq.trigger_engine1("TRIG_ENGINE_J")
daq.trigger_source1("EXTERNAL")
daq.trigger_slope1("TRIG_SLOPE_POSITIVE")
daq.trigger_level1(160)
daq.external_trigger_coupling("DC")
daq.external_trigger_range("ETR_2V5")
daq.trigger_delay(0)
daq.timeout_ticks(0)

# Configure the acquisition parameters
daq.set_acquisition_mode("NPT")
daq.set_record_length(1024)
daq.set_buffers_per_acquisition(10)
daq.set_trigger_delay(0)
daq.set_trigger_timeout(0)

# Start the acquisition
daq.start_acquisition()

# Read the acquired data
data = daq.acquire()

# Stop the acquisition
daq.stop_acquisition()

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq.close()
```

This script connects to the ATS9360 DAQ board using the `AlazarTech_ATS9360` driver from Qcodes. It then configures various settings such as clock source, sample rate, trigger settings, and acquisition parameters. After starting the acquisition, it reads the acquired data and stops the acquisition. Finally, it disconnects from the DAQ board.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, including Qcodes and the AlazarTech driver for the ATS9360 board.
