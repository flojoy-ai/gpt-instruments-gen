To connect to a KEYSIGHT 33622A Function Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33600A import Keysight_33600A

# Create an instance of the instrument driver
instrument = Keysight_33600A('instrument_name', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the function generator
# For example, you can set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz
instrument.ch1.frequency(1e3)

# You can also read the current frequency setting
frequency = instrument.ch1.frequency()

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'instrument_name'` with a unique name for your instrument and `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your KEYSIGHT 33622A Function Generator.
