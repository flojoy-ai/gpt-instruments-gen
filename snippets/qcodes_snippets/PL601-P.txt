To connect to a PL601-P Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument.channel import ChannelList

class AimTTiChannel(VisaInstrument):
    # ... implementation of AimTTiChannel class ...

class AimTTi(VisaInstrument):
    # ... implementation of AimTTi class ...

# Create an instance of the AimTTi instrument
aim_tti = AimTTi('aim_tti', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
aim_tti.connect()

# Access the channels of the power supply
channels = aim_tti.channels

# Access individual channels
channel1 = channels.ch1
channel2 = channels.ch2

# Set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V
channel1.volt(5)

# Set the current of channel 2 to 1A
channel2.curr(1)

# Disconnect from the instrument
aim_tti.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource address of your PL601-P Power Supply.
