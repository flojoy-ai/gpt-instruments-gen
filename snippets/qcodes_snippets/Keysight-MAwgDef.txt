To connect to a Keysight MAwgDef RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_MAwgDef import Keysight_MAwgDef

# Connect to the instrument
mawg = Keysight_MAwgDef('mawg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(mawg.idn())

# Set the output frequency to 1 GHz
mawg.frequency(1e9)

# Set the output power to -10 dBm
mawg.power(-10)

# Enable the output
mawg.output(True)

# Disconnect from the instrument
mawg.close()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight_MAwgDef` instrument driver. It then connects to the instrument using the specified VISA address. You can replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your instrument.

The script then demonstrates some basic operations such as printing the instrument ID, setting the output frequency and power, enabling the output, and finally disconnecting from the instrument.

Note: Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies and the Qcodes library before running this script.
