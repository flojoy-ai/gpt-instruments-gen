To connect to a Keysight 34411A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_34411A import Keysight_34411A

# Create an instance of the Keysight_34411A driver
multimeter = Keysight_34411A(name='multimeter', address='your_device_address')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

This script imports the `Keysight_34411A` driver from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight` module. It then creates an instance of the `Keysight_34411A` driver, specifying a name for the instrument and the address of the device.

After creating the instance, you can connect to the multimeter using the `connect()` method. Once connected, you can perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter.

Finally, you can disconnect from the multimeter using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure you replace `'your_device_address'` with the actual address of your Keysight 34411A Multimeter.
