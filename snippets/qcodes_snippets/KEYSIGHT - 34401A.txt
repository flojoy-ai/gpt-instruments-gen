Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a KEYSIGHT - 34401A Multimeter:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344XXA import Keysight_344XXA

# Create an instance of the Keysight_344XXA driver
multimeter = Keysight_344XXA('multimeter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform some measurements
voltage = multimeter.volt()
current = multimeter.curr()

# Print the measurement results
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Current: {current} A")

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `Keysight_344XXA` driver from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight` module. We then create an instance of the driver, specifying the name of the instrument (`multimeter`) and the VISA resource name (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR`). 

Next, we connect to the multimeter using the `connect()` method. We can then perform measurements using the various measurement functions provided by the driver, such as `volt()` for voltage measurements and `curr()` for current measurements. 

Finally, we print the measurement results and disconnect from the multimeter using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your KEYSIGHT - 34401A Multimeter.
