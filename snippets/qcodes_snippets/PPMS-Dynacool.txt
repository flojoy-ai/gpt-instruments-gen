Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a PPMS DynaCool Spectrometer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QuantumDesign.DynaCoolPPMS import DynaCool

# Connect to the DynaCool instrument
dynacool = DynaCool('dynacool', 'TCPIP0::127.0.0.1::5000::SOCKET')

# Print the instrument ID
print(dynacool.get_idn())

# Set the temperature setpoint to 10 K
dynacool.temperature_setpoint(10)

# Ramp the field to 1 T in blocking mode
dynacool.field_target(1)
dynacool.ramp(mode='blocking')

# Get the measured field
field = dynacool.field_measured()
print(f"Measured field: {field} T")

# Close the connection to the instrument
dynacool.close()
```

This script connects to the DynaCool instrument using the IP address and port specified in the `address` argument of the `DynaCool` constructor. It then sets the temperature setpoint to 10 K and ramps the field to 1 T in blocking mode. Finally, it retrieves the measured field value and prints it. The connection to the instrument is closed at the end of the script using the `close()` method.
