Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9373-12 bit, 4 GS/s DAQ board:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS import AlazarTech_ATS
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9373 import AlazarTechATS9373

# Connect to the ATS9373 board
ats = AlazarTechATS9373('ats', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Print the board ID
print(ats.get_idn())

# Set the clock source to INTERNAL_CLOCK
ats.clock_source('INTERNAL_CLOCK')

# Set the sample rate to 4 GS/s
ats.sample_rate(4_000_000_000)

# Set other parameters as needed

# Perform data acquisition
data = ats.acquire()

# Process the acquired data as needed

# Disconnect from the board
ats.close()
```

Note that you need to have the `ATSApi.dll` file in the specified path for the script to work.
