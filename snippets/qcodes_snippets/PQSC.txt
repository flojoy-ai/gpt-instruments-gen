To connect to a PQSC Quantum Computing Control System using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import PQSC

# Connect to the PQSC instrument
pqsc = PQSC("pqsc", "dev1234")

# Print the instrument ID
print(pqsc.IDN())

# Arm the PQSC
pqsc.arm()

# Start sending out triggers
pqsc.run()

# Wait until trigger generation and feedback processing is done
pqsc.wait_done()

# Stop the trigger generation
pqsc.stop()

# Close the connection to the instrument
pqsc.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and create an instance of the `PQSC` instrument driver. We provide the instrument name ("pqsc") and the instrument address ("dev1234") as arguments to the `PQSC` constructor.

We then use various methods of the `PQSC` instrument to interact with the instrument. For example, we can use the `arm()` method to prepare the PQSC for triggering the instruments, the `run()` method to start sending out triggers, and the `wait_done()` method to wait until trigger generation and feedback processing is done.

Finally, we close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.

Note: Replace "dev1234" with the actual address of your PQSC instrument.
