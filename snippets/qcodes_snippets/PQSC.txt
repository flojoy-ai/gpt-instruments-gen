To connect to a PQSC using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import PQSC

# Create a connection to the PQSC instrument
pqsc = PQSC("pqsc", "dev1234")

# Connect to the instrument
pqsc.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument for measurements
# For example, you can arm and run the PQSC
pqsc.arm_and_run()

# Stop the trigger generation
pqsc.stop()

# Disconnect from the instrument
pqsc.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and create an instance of the `PQSC` instrument driver. We provide a name for the instrument ("pqsc") and the device identifier ("dev1234") as arguments to the `PQSC` constructor.

Then, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. After connecting, we can use the instrument for measurements. In this example, we arm and run the PQSC using the `arm_and_run()` method, and then stop the trigger generation using the `stop()` method.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace "dev1234" with the actual device identifier of your PQSC instrument.
