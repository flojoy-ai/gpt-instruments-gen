To connect to a Keithley 2000 Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2000 import Keithley_2000

# Create an instance of the Keithley 2000 driver
keithley = Keithley_2000("keithley", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.IDN())

# Set the mode to DC voltage
keithley.mode("dc voltage")

# Set the range to 10V
keithley.range(10)

# Enable auto range
keithley.auto_range_enabled(True)

# Set the NPLC to 1
keithley.nplc(1)

# Trigger a measurement
keithley.trigger()

# Read the measured value
value = keithley.amplitude()
print("Measured value:", value)

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `Keithley_2000` driver and connects to the instrument using the specified address (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR`). It then sets various parameters such as mode, range, auto range, and NPLC, triggers a measurement, and reads the measured value.

Note: Make sure to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your Keithley 2000 Multimeter.
