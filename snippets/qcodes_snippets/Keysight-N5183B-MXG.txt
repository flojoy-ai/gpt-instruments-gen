To connect to a Keysight N5183B MXG RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.N51x1 import N51x1
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightN5183B import KeysightN5183B

# Create an instance of the KeysightN5183B instrument
instrument = KeysightN5183B('my_instrument', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the frequency and power level
instrument.frequency(1e9)  # Set the frequency to 1 GHz
instrument.power(-10)  # Set the power level to -10 dBm

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your instrument.
