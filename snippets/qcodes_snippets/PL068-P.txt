Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a PL068-P Power Supply:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument.channel import ChannelList

class AimTTiChannel(VisaInstrument):
    # ... implementation of AimTTiChannel class ...

class AimTTi(VisaInstrument):
    # ... implementation of AimTTi class ...

# Connect to the PL068-P Power Supply
pl068p = AimTTi('pl068p', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Access the channels of the power supply
channels = pl068p.channels

# Set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V
channels.ch1.volt(5)

# Set the current range of channel 1 to high range
channels.ch1.curr_range(2)

# Turn on the output of channel 1
channels.ch1.output(1)

# Get the voltage and current values of channel 1
voltage = channels.ch1.volt()
current = channels.ch1.curr()

# Print the voltage and current values
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Current: {current} A")

# Disconnect from the power supply
pl068p.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address of your PL068-P Power Supply.
