Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keithley 2604B Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600_channels import Keithley_2600

# Connect to the Keithley 2604B Power Supply
keithley = Keithley_2600('keithley', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.IDN())

# Set the voltage to 1V on channel A
keithley.chA.voltage(1)

# Set the current limit to 100mA on channel A
keithley.chA.current_limit(0.1)

# Enable output on channel A
keithley.chA.output('on')

# Disable output on channel A
keithley.chA.output('off')

# Close the connection to the instrument
keithley.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. We then create an instance of the `Keithley_2600` class, passing the instrument's connection string as the second argument. The connection string specifies the communication protocol and address of the instrument.

We can then use the various methods and properties of the `Keithley_2600` class to interact with the instrument. For example, we can use the `voltage()` method to set the voltage on a specific channel, the `current_limit()` method to set the current limit, and the `output()` method to enable or disable the output on a channel.

Finally, we close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or connection string of your Keithley 2604B Power Supply.
