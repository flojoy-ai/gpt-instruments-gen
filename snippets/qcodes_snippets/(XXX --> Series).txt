Sure! Here's an example of a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a (XXX --> Series) instrument:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.XXX import XXXSeries

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = XXXSeries("XXX", "address")

# Print the instrument ID
print("Instrument ID:", instrument.IDN())

# Set some parameters
instrument.parameter1.set(10)
instrument.parameter2.set(0.5)

# Read some parameters
print("Parameter 1:", instrument.parameter1.get())
print("Parameter 2:", instrument.parameter2.get())

# Close the connection
instrument.close()
```

In this example, you need to replace `"XXX"` with the appropriate driver name for your instrument and `"address"` with the actual address of your instrument. The `XXXSeries` class is the driver for the instrument, and you can use its methods to interact with the instrument, such as setting and reading parameters.

Note that this is just a basic example to get you started. You may need to refer to the instrument's documentation or the Qcodes documentation for more details on how to use specific features of your instrument.
