To connect to a Lakeshore Model 336 Temperature Controller using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model336 import Model336

# Create an instance of the Model336 instrument
lakeshore = Model336("lakeshore", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7777::SOCKET")

# Connect to the instrument
lakeshore.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can read the temperature from a sensor
temperature = lakeshore.temperature()

# You can also set the temperature setpoint
lakeshore.temperature_setpoint(300)

# Disconnect from the instrument when you're done
lakeshore.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7777::SOCKET"` with the actual IP address and port of your Lakeshore Model 336 Temperature Controller.
