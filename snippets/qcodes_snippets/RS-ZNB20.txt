To connect to a R&S ZNB20 Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB.ZNB import ZNB

# Create an instance of the ZNB20 Network Analyzer
znb = ZNB('znb', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
znb.connect()
```

In the code above, we import the `ZNB` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB.ZNB` module. Then, we create an instance of the `ZNB` class with the desired name (`znb`) and the appropriate VISA resource string (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR`) for your specific instrument.

Finally, we call the `connect()` method to establish a connection to the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the correct VISA resource string for your specific instrument.
