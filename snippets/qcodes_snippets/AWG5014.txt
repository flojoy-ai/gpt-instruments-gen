Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Tektronix AWG5014 RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG5014 import TektronixAWG5014

# Connect to the AWG5014
awg = TektronixAWG5014('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Set the clock source to internal
awg.clock_source('INT')

# Set the waveform for channel 1
awg.ch1_waveform('SINE')

# Set the amplitude for channel 1
awg.ch1_amplitude(0.5)

# Run the AWG
awg.run()

# Disconnect from the AWG5014
awg.close()
```

This script first imports the necessary modules and then creates an instance of the `TektronixAWG5014` class, which represents the AWG5014 RF Signal Generator. The IP address of the instrument is passed as an argument to the constructor.

The script then sets the clock source to internal and sets the waveform and amplitude for channel 1. Finally, it runs the AWG and closes the connection.

Note that you will need to install the Qcodes library and the Tektronix AWG5014 driver before running this script. You can install Qcodes using pip:

```
pip install qcodes
```

And you can install the Tektronix AWG5014 driver using pip as well:

```
pip install qcodes-drivers-tektronix-AWG5014
```

Make sure to replace the IP address in the script with the actual IP address of your AWG5014 instrument.
