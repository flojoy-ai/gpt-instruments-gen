To connect to a Keysight E8267D RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_E8267D import Keysight_E8267D

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = Keysight_E8267D("signal_generator", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform operations
frequency = signal_generator.frequency()
print("Current frequency:", frequency)

# Set a new frequency
signal_generator.frequency(1e9)

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` with the actual address of your Keysight E8267D RF Signal Generator.
