To connect to a KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_PNA import Keysight_PNA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna = Keysight_PNA('pna', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Add the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer to the station
station.add_component(pna)

# Print the available options on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
print(pna.get_options())

# Print the trace catalog on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
print(pna.get_trace_catalog())

# Select a trace on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer by name
pna.select_trace_by_name('S11')

# Set the start and stop frequencies on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.start(1e6)
pna.stop(1e9)

# Set the power on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.power(-10)

# Set the number of points in a sweep on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.points(1001)

# Set the IF bandwidth on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.if_bandwidth(1e3)

# Set the electrical delay on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.electrical_delay(0)

# Set the sweep mode on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.sweep_mode('CONT')

# Run a sweep on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.run_sweep()

# Get the data from the selected trace on the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
data = pna.traces[0].get()

# Print the data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer
pna.close()
```

This script creates a station to hold the instruments and connects to the KEYSIGHT 5222B Network Analyzer using the `Keysight_PNA` driver from Qcodes. It then performs various operations on the network analyzer, such as getting the available options, selecting a trace, setting frequency and power parameters, running a sweep, and getting the data from the selected trace. Finally, it disconnects from the network analyzer.
