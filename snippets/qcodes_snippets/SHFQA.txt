Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a SHFQA Quantum Analyzer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import SHFQA

# Connect to the SHFQA Quantum Analyzer
shfqa = SHFQA("shfqa", "dev1234")

# Print the available QA channels
print(shfqa.qachannels())

# Configure the first QA channel
channel = shfqa.qachannels[0]
channel.configure_channel(
    input_range=0,
    output_range=0,
    center_frequency=5e9,
    mode="spectroscopy"
)

# Run the spectroscopy measurement
channel.spectroscopy.run()

# Wait for the measurement to finish
channel.spectroscopy.wait_done()

# Read the measurement data
data = channel.spectroscopy.read()

# Print the measurement data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the SHFQA Quantum Analyzer
shfqa.close()
```

Note: Replace `"dev1234"` with the actual serial number of your SHFQA Quantum Analyzer.
