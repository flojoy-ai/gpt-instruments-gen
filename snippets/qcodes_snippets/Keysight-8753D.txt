Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight 8753D Network Analyzer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_8753D import Keysight_8753D

# Create an instance of the Keysight 8753D Network Analyzer
analyzer = Keysight_8753D("analyzer", address="GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
analyzer.connect()

# Print the start frequency
print("Start Frequency:", analyzer.start_freq())

# Set the stop frequency to 1 GHz
analyzer.stop_freq(1e9)

# Set the number of points in the trace to 101
analyzer.trace_points(101)

# Prepare the trace
analyzer.trace.prepare_trace()

# Get the trace data
trace_data = analyzer.trace()

# Print the trace data
print("Trace Data:", trace_data)

# Disconnect from the instrument
analyzer.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `Keysight_8753D` instrument driver and connects to the instrument using the specified address. It then interacts with the instrument by setting parameters and getting trace data. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
