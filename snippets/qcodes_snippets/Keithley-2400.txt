To connect to a Keithley 2400 Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2400 import Keithley2400

# Create an instance of the Keithley2400 instrument
keithley = Keithley2400("keithley", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform measurements and control the power supply
# For example, you can set the voltage range
keithley.rangev(10)  # Set the voltage range to 10V

# You can also read the current value
current = keithley.curr()  # Read the current value

# Finally, disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. Then, we create an instance of the `Keithley2400` instrument by providing a name and the instrument's address (in this case, a TCP/IP address). Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method.

Once connected, we can use the instrument's parameters and methods to control and read measurements from the power supply. In the example, we set the voltage range using the `rangev` parameter and read the current value using the `curr` parameter.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
