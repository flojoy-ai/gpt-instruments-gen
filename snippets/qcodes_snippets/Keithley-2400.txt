To connect to a Keithley 2400 Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2400 import Keithley2400

# Create an instance of the Keithley2400 instrument
keithley = Keithley2400("keithley", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform measurements and control the power supply
# For example, you can set the voltage range
keithley.rangev(10)  # Set the voltage range to 10V

# You can also set the current range
keithley.rangei(1)  # Set the current range to 1A

# Set the voltage compliance
keithley.compliancev(5)  # Set the voltage compliance to 5V

# Set the current compliance
keithley.compliancei(0.1)  # Set the current compliance to 0.1A

# Set the output mode to voltage
keithley.mode("VOLT")  # Set the mode to voltage

# Set the sense mode to voltage
keithley.sense("VOLT")  # Set the sense mode to voltage

# Enable the output
keithley.output("on")  # Turn on the output

# Set the voltage level
keithley.volt(2)  # Set the voltage level to 2V

# Read the current
current = keithley.curr()  # Read the current

# Read the resistance
resistance = keithley.resistance()  # Read the resistance

# Disable the output
keithley.output("off")  # Turn off the output

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `Keithley2400` instrument and connects to it using the specified address. It then uses the instrument's parameters and methods to control the power supply, set voltage and current ranges, set compliance values, set the output mode and sense mode, enable/disable the output, and read voltage, current, and resistance values. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
