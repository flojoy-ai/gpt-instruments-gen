To connect to a Keysight 33510B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('signal_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the signal generator
# For example, you can set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz
signal_generator.ch1.frequency(1e6)

# You can also read the current frequency setting
frequency = signal_generator.ch1.frequency()
print(f"The current frequency is: {frequency} Hz")

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `WaveformGenerator_33XXX` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX` module. It then connects to the instrument using the specified VISA resource address (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR` in this example).

Once connected, you can use the instrument instance to control the signal generator. In the example, it sets the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz using the `frequency` parameter of the `ch1` submodule. It then reads the current frequency setting and prints it.

Finally, the script disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect` method of the instrument instance.
