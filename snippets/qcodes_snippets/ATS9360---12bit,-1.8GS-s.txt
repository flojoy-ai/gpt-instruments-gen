Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9360 - 12bit, 1.8GS/s DAQ board:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.ATS9360 import ATS9360

# Connect to the ATS9360 DAQ board
daq = ATS9360("daq", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Print the instrument ID
print(daq.IDN())

# Set the sample rate to 1.8 GS/s
daq.sample_rate(1.8e9)

# Set the number of samples to acquire
daq.num_points(1000)

# Arm the acquisition
daq.arm()

# Start the acquisition
daq.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
daq.wait_done()

# Read the acquired data
data = daq.data()

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. Then, we create an instance of the `ATS9360` instrument driver, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` assumes that the DAQ board is connected to the IP address `192.168.1.1`.

We can then use various methods of the `ATS9360` instrument driver to interact with the DAQ board. In this example, we print the instrument ID, set the sample rate to 1.8 GS/s, set the number of samples to acquire, arm the acquisition, start the acquisition, wait for it to complete, and finally read the acquired data.

Note that you may need to modify the connection string and other parameters based on your specific setup.
