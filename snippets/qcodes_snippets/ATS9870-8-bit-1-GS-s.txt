To connect to an ATS9870 board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9870 import AlazarTechATS9870

# Create an instance of the AlazarTechATS9870 driver
ats9870 = AlazarTechATS9870('ats9870', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Connect to the board
ats9870.connect()

# Perform operations with the board

# Disconnect from the board
ats9870.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `AlazarTechATS9870` driver, specifying the name of the instrument as `'ats9870'` and the path to the ATSApi.dll file. Then, it connects to the board using the `connect()` method and performs any desired operations. Finally, it disconnects from the board using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll'` with the actual path to the ATSApi.dll file on your system.
