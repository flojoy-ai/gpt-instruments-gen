To connect to a KEYSIGHT MAwgDef RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_MAwgDef import Keysight_MAwgDef

# Create an instance of the instrument
mawg = Keysight_MAwgDef("mawg", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
mawg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the output frequency
mawg.frequency(1e9)

# Disconnect from the instrument
mawg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual VISA address of your KEYSIGHT MAwgDef RF Signal Generator.
