To connect to a Keithley 2612B Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2600
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2612B import Keithley2612B

# Create an instance of the Keithley2612B driver
keithley = Keithley2612B('keithley', 'TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Now you can use the Keithley2612B instrument for various operations
# For example, you can set the voltage and current limits
keithley.voltage_limit(10)  # Set the voltage limit to 10 V
keithley.current_limit(0.1)  # Set the current limit to 0.1 A

# You can also perform measurements
voltage = keithley.voltage()  # Measure the voltage
current = keithley.current()  # Measure the current

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR'` with the actual address of your Keithley 2612B Power Supply.
