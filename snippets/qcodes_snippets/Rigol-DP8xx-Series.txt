Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Rigol DP8xx-Series Power Supply:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DP8xx import DP832

# Create an instance of the DP832 power supply
power_supply = DP832("power_supply", "USB0::0x1AB1::0x0E11::DP8C203600050::INSTR")

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Print the installed options
print(power_supply.installed_options())

# Set the voltage and current for channel 1
power_supply.ch1.set_voltage(3.0)
power_supply.ch1.set_current(1.0)

# Enable the output for channel 1
power_supply.ch1.state(True)

# Read the measured voltage and current for channel 1
voltage = power_supply.ch1.voltage()
current = power_supply.ch1.current()

# Print the measured voltage and current
print(f"Measured Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Measured Current: {current} A")

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `DP832` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DP8xx` module. It then connects to the power supply using the specified address (in this case, a USB connection). The installed options are printed using the `installed_options()` method.

The voltage and current for channel 1 are set using the `set_voltage()` and `set_current()` methods. The output for channel 1 is enabled using the `state()` method.

The measured voltage and current for channel 1 are read using the `voltage()` and `current()` methods. The values are then printed.

Finally, the script disconnects from the power supply using the `disconnect()` method.
