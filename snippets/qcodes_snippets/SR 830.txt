To connect to a SR 830 Lock-in Amplifier using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR830 import SR830

# Create an instance of the SR830 instrument
lockin = SR830('lockin', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
lockin.connect()

# Now you can use the lockin object to control and read data from the lock-in amplifier
# For example, you can read the X and Y values:
x = lockin.X()
y = lockin.Y()

# You can also set parameters of the lock-in amplifier:
lockin.frequency(1000)  # Set the frequency to 1000 Hz

# Disconnect from the instrument when you're done
lockin.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual address of your SR 830 Lock-in Amplifier.
