Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight E4980A Multimeter:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_E4980A import KeysightE4980A

# Create an instance of the instrument
meter = KeysightE4980A("meter", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
meter.connect()

# Perform measurements
impedance = meter.measure_impedance.get()
print("Impedance:", impedance)

# Disconnect from the instrument
meter.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `KeysightE4980A` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_E4980A` module. We then create an instance of the instrument by providing a name and the instrument's address (in this case, a TCP/IP address). We connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method.

We can then perform measurements using the instrument's parameters and methods. In this example, we use the `measure_impedance` parameter to get the impedance measurement. Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
