To connect to a Keysight 8753D Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_8753D import Keysight_8753D

# Create an instance of the instrument
instrument = Keysight_8753D("instrument_name", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform measurements
# For example, you can set the start frequency
instrument.start_freq(1e6)

# You can also read the trace data
trace_data = instrument.trace()

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"instrument_name"` with the desired name for your instrument, and `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your Keysight 8753D Network Analyzer.
