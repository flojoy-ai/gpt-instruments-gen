To connect to a Keysight 8753D Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_8753D import Keysight_8753D

# Create an instance of the instrument
na = Keysight_8753D('na', 'GPIB0::1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
na.connect()

# Perform measurements or set instrument parameters
na.set_measurement('S11')
na.set_start_frequency(1e6)
na.set_stop_frequency(1e9)
na.set_numpoints(101)
na.set_power(-10)

# Get the trace data
freqs, data = na.get_trace()

# Print the data
print(freqs)
print(data)

# Disconnect from the instrument
na.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to have Qcodes and the Keysight_8753D instrument driver installed in order to run this script.
