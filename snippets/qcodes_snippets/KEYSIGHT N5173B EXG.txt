To connect to a KEYSIGHT N5173B EXG RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N51x1 import N51x1

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the KEYSIGHT N5173B EXG RF Signal Generator
n5173b = N51x1('n5173b', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(n5173b)

# Print the instrument's IDN information
print(n5173b.get_idn())

# Set the power to -10 dBm
n5173b.power(-10)

# Set the frequency to 1 GHz
n5173b.frequency(1e9)

# Enable the RF output
n5173b.rf_output('on')

# Disable the RF output
n5173b.rf_output('off')

# Close the connection to the instrument
n5173b.close()
```

This script creates a station to hold the instrument, connects to the KEYSIGHT N5173B EXG RF Signal Generator using the `N51x1` driver, adds the instrument to the station, and performs various operations such as getting the IDN information, setting the power and frequency, and enabling/disabling the RF output. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
