Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9360 - 12bit, 1.8GS/s DAQ board:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.ATS9360 import ATS9360

# Connect to the ATS9360 DAQ board
daq = ATS9360("daq", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Print the instrument ID
print(daq.IDN())

# Set the sample rate to 1.8 GS/s
daq.sample_rate(1.8e9)

# Set the number of samples to acquire
daq.num_points(1000)

# Arm the acquisition
daq.arm()

# Start the acquisition
daq.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
daq.wait_done()

# Read the acquired data
data = daq.data()

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. Then, we create an instance of the `ATS9360` instrument driver, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` assumes that the DAQ board is connected to the IP address `192.168.1.1`.

We can then use various methods of the `ATS9360` instrument driver to interact with the DAQ board. For example, we can use the `sample_rate` method to set the sample rate to 1.8 GS/s, the `num_points` method to set the number of samples to acquire, and the `arm` and `run` methods to start the acquisition.

After the acquisition is complete, we can use the `data` method to read the acquired data. Finally, we close the connection to the DAQ board using the `close` method.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, including Qcodes and the Tektronix instrument driver for ATS9360.
