To connect to the ATS9360 DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9360 import AlazarTech_ATS9360

# Connect to the ATS9360 DAQ board
daq = AlazarTech_ATS9360("daq", "ATS9360")

# Set the clock source and samplerate
daq.clock_source("INTERNAL_CLOCK")
daq.sample_rate(1.8e9)

# Set the trigger parameters
daq.trigger_source1("EXTERNAL")
daq.trigger_level1(0.5)
daq.trigger_edge1("RISING")

# Set the acquisition parameters
daq.samples_per_record(1024)
daq.records_per_buffer(100)
daq.buffers_per_acquisition(10)

# Start the acquisition
daq.acquisition_mode("NPT")
daq.start_acquisition()

# Read the acquired data
data = daq.acquire()

# Stop the acquisition
daq.stop_acquisition()

# Close the connection to the DAQ board
daq.close()
```

Note that you may need to install the `qcodes` package and the `AlazarTech` driver before running this code. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install qcodes
pip install qcodes-contrib-drivers
```

Make sure to replace `"daq"` and `"ATS9360"` with the appropriate names for your instrument and instrument driver.
