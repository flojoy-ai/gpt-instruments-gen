To connect to a PL303QMT-P Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.aimtti.AimTTi import AimTTi

# Create an instance of the AimTTi instrument
aim_tti = AimTTi("aim_tti", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
aim_tti.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform operations
# For example, to get the voltage of channel 1:
voltage = aim_tti.ch1.volt.get()
print("Voltage:", voltage)

# To set the current range of channel 2 to high range:
aim_tti.ch2.curr_range.set(2)

# To increment the voltage of channel 1 by the step size:
aim_tti.ch1.increment_volt_by_step_size()

# Disconnect from the instrument
aim_tti.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` with the actual VISA resource address of your PL303QMT-P Power Supply.
