```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_P9374A import KeysightP9374A

# Create an instance of the KeysightP9374A instrument
pna = KeysightP9374A('pna', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
pna.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
pna.get_options()

# Disconnect from the instrument
pna.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and the `KeysightP9374A` instrument driver.
2. Create an instance of the `KeysightP9374A` instrument with a name ('pna') and the instrument's address ('TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR').
3. Connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method.
4. Perform operations with the instrument, in this case, calling the `get_options()` method.
5. Disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
