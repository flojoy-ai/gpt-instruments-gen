To connect to a Keysight 33210A Function Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
instrument = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('my_instrument', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the function generator
# For example, you can set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz
instrument.ch1.frequency(1e3)

# You can also read the current frequency setting
frequency = instrument.ch1.frequency()
print(f"The current frequency is {frequency} Hz")

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `WaveformGenerator_33XXX` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX` module. It then connects to the instrument using the specified VISA resource address (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR` in this example).

Once connected, you can use the instrument instance to control the function generator. In the example, it sets the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz using the `frequency` parameter of the `ch1` submodule. It then reads the current frequency setting and prints it.

Finally, the script disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect` method of the instrument instance.
