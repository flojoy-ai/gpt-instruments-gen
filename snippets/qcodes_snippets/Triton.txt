Sure! Here's an example of a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Triton Dilution Refrigerator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.oxford.triton import Triton

# Connect to the Triton Dilution Refrigerator
triton = Triton("triton", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::5000::SOCKET")

# Initialize the instrument
triton.init()

# Set the temperature of the mixing chamber to 100 mK
triton.mixing_chamber.temperature(0.1)

# Close the connection to the Triton Dilution Refrigerator
triton.close()
```

In this example, we import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. We then create an instance of the `Triton` class, passing the IP address and port number of the Triton Dilution Refrigerator as arguments. 

Next, we initialize the instrument using the `init()` method. This step is important to establish communication with the instrument and ensure that it is ready for use.

We can then use various methods provided by the `Triton` class to control the instrument. In this example, we set the temperature of the mixing chamber to 100 mK using the `temperature()` method of the `mixing_chamber` attribute.

Finally, we close the connection to the Triton Dilution Refrigerator using the `close()` method.

Note that you may need to modify the IP address and port number in the `Triton` constructor to match the actual address and port of your Triton Dilution Refrigerator.
