Sure! Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Triton cryogenic system:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QuantumDesign.Triton import Triton

# Connect to the Triton cryogenic system
triton = Triton("triton", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::33576::SOCKET")

# Print the identification string of the Triton
print(triton.IDN())

# Close the connection to the Triton
triton.close()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules from Qcodes and specifically import the `Triton` class from the `QuantumDesign.Triton` module. We then create an instance of the `Triton` class, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string specifies the IP address and port number of the Triton cryogenic system.

We can then use the `IDN()` method of the `Triton` instance to retrieve the identification string of the Triton, which contains information about the instrument.

Finally, we close the connection to the Triton using the `close()` method of the `Triton` instance.

Note: Make sure to replace the IP address and port number in the connection string with the actual values for your Triton cryogenic system.
