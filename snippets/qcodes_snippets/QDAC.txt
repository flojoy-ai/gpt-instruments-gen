Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a QDAC Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.QDevil.QDac import QDac

# Connect to the QDAC Power Supply
qdac = QDac('qdac', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the firmware version
print(f"Firmware Version: {qdac.version}")

# Reset the QDAC Power Supply
qdac.reset()

# Set the voltage of channel 1 to 2V
qdac.channels.ch01.v(2)

# Get the current of channel 1
current = qdac.channels.ch01.i()
print(f"Current of channel 1: {current} A")

# Ramp the voltage of channel 2 from 0V to 5V in 1 second
qdac.ramp_voltages([2], [0], [5], 1)

# Print the status of all channels
qdac.print_overview()

# Disconnect from the QDAC Power Supply
qdac.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your QDAC Power Supply.
