```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.DP8xx import RigolDP821

# Create an instance of the RigolDP821 driver
dp821 = RigolDP821('dp821', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
dp821.connect()

# Perform operations using the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
dp821.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your Rigol DP821 Power Supply.
