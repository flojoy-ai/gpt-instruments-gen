Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a DPO7000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)  # Set channel 1 time per division to 0.1s

# Acquire and plot a waveform
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()
waveform.plot()

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "192.168.1.1" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1s, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots it. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
