Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a UHFQA:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import UHFQA

# Connect to the UHFQA instrument
uhfqa = UHFQA("uhfqa", "dev1234")

# Print the instrument ID
print("Instrument ID:", uhfqa.IDN())

# Set the integration time
uhfqa.integration_time(0.1)

# Perform a measurement
result = uhfqa.measure()

# Print the measurement result
print("Measurement result:", result)

# Close the connection to the instrument
uhfqa.close()
```

In this example, we import the necessary modules and create an instance of the UHFQA instrument using the `UHFQA` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst` module. We then print the instrument ID, set the integration time to 0.1 seconds, perform a measurement, and print the measurement result. Finally, we close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.
