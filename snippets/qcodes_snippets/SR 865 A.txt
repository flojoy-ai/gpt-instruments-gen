To connect to a SR 865 A Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR865 import SR865

# Create an instance of the SR865 driver
lockin = SR865("lockin", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
lockin.connect()

# Now you can use the lockin object to control the instrument
# For example, you can set the frequency and read the X value
lockin.frequency(1000)  # Set the frequency to 1000 Hz
x_value = lockin.X()  # Read the X value

# Disconnect from the instrument
lockin.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your lock-in amplifier.
