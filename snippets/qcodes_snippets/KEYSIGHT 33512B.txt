```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightAgilent_33XXX import Keysight33512B

# Create an instance of the Keysight33512B instrument
signal_generator = Keysight33512B('signal_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
# ...

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `Keysight33512B` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightAgilent_33XXX` module.
2. Create an instance of the `Keysight33512B` instrument with the name `'signal_generator'` and the appropriate address (`'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` in this example).
3. Connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method.
4. Perform any desired operations with the instrument.
5. Disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
