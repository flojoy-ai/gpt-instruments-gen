To connect to a Keysight B1500A Spectrum Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightB1500 import KeysightB1500

# Create an instance of the KeysightB1500 instrument
b1500 = KeysightB1500('b1500', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
b1500.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
b1500.disconnect()
```

This code creates an instance of the `KeysightB1500` instrument with the name 'b1500' and the specified address ('TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'). Then, it connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method. You can perform various operations with the instrument after connecting. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
