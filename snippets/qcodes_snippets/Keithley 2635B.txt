```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2635B import Keithley_2635B

# Connect to the Keithley 2635B Power Supply
keithley = Keithley_2635B('keithley', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.IDN())

# Set the voltage to 5V
keithley.voltage(5)

# Set the current limit to 1A
keithley.current_limit(1)

# Enable the output
keithley.output('on')

# Disable the output
keithley.output('off')

# Close the connection to the instrument
keithley.close()
```
In this code, we import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. We then create an instance of the `Keithley_2635B` class, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string specifies the communication protocol and the address of the instrument.

We can then use various methods of the `Keithley_2635B` class to interact with the instrument. For example, we can use the `IDN()` method to get the instrument identification string, `voltage()` method to set the voltage, `current_limit()` method to set the current limit, and `output()` method to enable or disable the output.

Finally, we close the connection to the instrument using the `close()` method.
