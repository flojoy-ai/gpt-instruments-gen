To connect to an ATS9373 board using Qcodes, you can use the `AlazarTech_ATS` driver provided by Qcodes. Here's an example script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9373 import AlazarTech_ATS9373

# Connect to the ATS9373 board
board = AlazarTech_ATS9373("board", system_id=1, board_id=1)

# Print the board information
print(board.get_idn())

# Configure the board settings
board.clock_source('INTERNAL_CLOCK')
board.sample_rate(4e9)
board.input_range1(0.4)
board.input_range2(0.4)
board.trigger_operation('J_or_K', 'OR', 'J', 'POSITIVE', 0.1, 'K', 'POSITIVE', 0.1)
board.trigger_delay(0)
board.trigger_timeout(0)
board.records_per_buffer(1)
board.records_per_acquisition(10)

# Start the acquisition
board.start_acquisition()

# Read the acquired data
data = board.acquire()

# Print the acquired data
print(data)

# Stop the acquisition
board.stop_acquisition()

# Disconnect from the board
board.close()
```

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed Qcodes and the AlazarTech ATS driver. You may need to modify the system_id and board_id parameters to match your specific setup.
