This script connects to a Keysight N5171B EXG RF Signal Generator using the Qcodes driver `N51x1`. It creates a station to hold the instrument, connects to the instrument using the instrument's IP address, adds the instrument to the station, and then performs various operations on the instrument such as setting the frequency, power, enabling RF output, and disabling pulse modulation. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
