Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight 34980A DAQ board:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_34980A import Keysight34980A

# Create an instance of the instrument
daq = Keysight34980A('daq', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
daq.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
daq.reset()
status = daq.get_status()
error = daq.get_error()

# Disconnect from the instrument
daq.disconnect()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight34980A` instrument with the name 'daq' and the specified address. It then connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method.

After connecting, the script performs some operations with the instrument, such as resetting it, getting the status and error messages. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
