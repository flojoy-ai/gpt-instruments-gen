This script connects to a KEYSIGHT N5171B EXG RF Signal Generator using the Qcodes driver `N51x1`. It creates a `Station` to hold the instrument, connects to the instrument using the instrument's IP address, adds the instrument to the station, and prints the IDN information of the instrument.

Then, it sets the frequency to 1 GHz, the power to -10 dBm, and enables the RF output. Finally, it closes the connection to the instrument.
