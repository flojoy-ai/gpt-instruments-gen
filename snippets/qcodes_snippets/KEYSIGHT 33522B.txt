```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightAgilent_33XXX import Keysight33522B

# Create an instance of the Keysight33522B instrument
instrument = Keysight33522B('instrument_name', 'USB0::0x0957::0x2307::MY52800838::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

In the code above, we import the `Keysight33522B` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightAgilent_33XXX` module. We then create an instance of the `Keysight33522B` instrument by providing a name for the instrument and the instrument's address (in this case, a USB address).

We then connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. After connecting, you can perform various operations with the instrument, such as setting waveform parameters, generating waveforms, etc.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
