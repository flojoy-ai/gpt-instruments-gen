To connect to a Lakeshore Model 372 Temperature Controller using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_372 import LakeshoreModel372

# Create an instance of the LakeshoreModel372 driver
lakeshore = LakeshoreModel372("lakeshore", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7777::SOCKET")

# Connect to the instrument
lakeshore.connect()

# Print the identification string of the instrument
print(lakeshore.IDN())

# Disconnect from the instrument
lakeshore.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `LakeshoreModel372` driver, specifying the name and address of the instrument. The `connect()` method is then called to establish a connection to the instrument. The `IDN()` method is used to retrieve the identification string of the instrument, which can be printed to verify the connection. Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to close the connection to the instrument.
