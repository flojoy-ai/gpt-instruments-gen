```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N52xx import Keysight_N52xx

# Connect to the network analyzer
nwa = Keysight_N52xx('nwa', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the IDN string of the network analyzer
print(nwa.IDN())

# Close the connection to the network analyzer
nwa.close()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and `Keysight_N52xx` from `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N52xx`.
2. Create an instance of the `Keysight_N52xx` class and pass the instrument name and connection string as arguments. Replace `'nwa'` with the desired instrument name and `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the appropriate connection string for your network analyzer.
3. Use the `IDN()` method to retrieve the identification string of the network analyzer and print it.
4. Close the connection to the network analyzer using the `close()` method.
