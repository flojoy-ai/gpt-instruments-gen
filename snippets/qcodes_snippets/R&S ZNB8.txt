To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz ZNB8 Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB import RohdeSchwarzZNB8

# Create an instance of the RohdeSchwarzZNB8 driver
znb = RohdeSchwarzZNB8("znb", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
znb.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument for measurements
# For example, you can query the instrument's ID
print(znb.IDN())

# Close the connection to the instrument
znb.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `RohdeSchwarzZNB8` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB` module. We then create an instance of the `RohdeSchwarzZNB8` driver, passing a name for the instrument and the instrument's address (in this case, a TCP/IP address).

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. Once connected, we can use the instrument for measurements. In this example, we query the instrument's ID using the `IDN()` method and print the result.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` with the actual address of your Rohde & Schwarz ZNB8 Network Analyzer.
