Unfortunately, the provided code is not using Qcodes to connect to the Keithley 2614B Power Supplies. It is a custom implementation specific to the K2614 device. To connect to the Keithley 2614B Power Supplies using Qcodes, you would need to use the appropriate Qcodes driver for the device.

Here's an example of how you can connect to a Keithley 2614B Power Supply using Qcodes:

```python
from qcodes import VisaInstrument

class Keithley2614B(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        super().__init__(name, address)

        # Add your initialization code here

    def get_idn(self):
        return self.ask('*IDN?')

# Create an instance of the Keithley2614B instrument
keithley = Keithley2614B('keithley', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Get the instrument identification
print(keithley.get_idn())

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your Keithley 2614B Power Supply.

This example demonstrates how to create a custom Qcodes instrument class for the Keithley 2614B Power Supply and connect to it using the VISA address. You can then use the Qcodes API to interact with the instrument.

Please note that you may need to install the appropriate Qcodes driver for the Keithley 2614B Power Supply before running this code.
