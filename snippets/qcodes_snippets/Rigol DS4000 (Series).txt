To connect to a Rigol DS4000 Oscilloscope using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rigol.rigol_ds4000 import RigolDS4000

# Create an instance of the RigolDS4000 instrument
scope = RigolDS4000("scope", "USB0::0x1AB1::0x04CE::DS4A203400948::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
scope.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can start the acquisition
scope.run()

# You can also read the waveform data from a specific channel
channel1_data = scope.channels.ch1.curvedata()

# Print the first 10 points of the waveform
print(channel1_data[:10])

# Disconnect from the instrument
scope.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `RigolDS4000` instrument, specifying the name and the VISA address of the instrument. Then, it connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method. After that, you can use various methods and parameters of the instrument to control and read data from the oscilloscope. Finally, the script disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
