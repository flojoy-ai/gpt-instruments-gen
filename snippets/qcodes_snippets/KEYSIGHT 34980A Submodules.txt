To connect to a KEYSIGHT 34980A Submodule DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import VisaInstrument, InstrumentChannel
from typing import Union, List, Tuple, Optional


class KeysightSubModule(InstrumentChannel):
    # ... (code omitted for brevity)


class KeysightSwitchMatrixSubModule(KeysightSubModule):
    # ... (code omitted for brevity)


# Create an instance of the KEYSIGHT 34980A Submodule DAQ board
submodule = KeysightSwitchMatrixSubModule(parent=None, name='Submodule', slot=1)

# Connect to the instrument
submodule.connect()

# Perform operations on the submodule, such as connecting channels
submodule.connect_paths([(1, 1), (2, 3)])

# Disconnect channels
submodule.disconnect_paths([(1, 1), (2, 3)])

# Check if a channel is open/disconnected
is_open = submodule.is_open(1, 1)

# Check if a channel is closed/connected
is_closed = submodule.is_closed(1, 1)

# Check if a list of channels is closed/connected
are_closed = submodule.are_closed([(1, 1), (2, 3)])

# Check if a list of channels is open/disconnected
are_open = submodule.are_open([(1, 1), (2, 3)])

# Disconnect from the instrument
submodule.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `KeysightSwitchMatrixSubModule` class, which is a subclass of `KeysightSubModule` and `InstrumentChannel`. It then connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method and performs various operations on the submodule, such as connecting and disconnecting channels. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
