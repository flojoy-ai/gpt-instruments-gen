```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N5245A import Keysight_N5245A

# Connect to the instrument
n5245a = Keysight_N5245A("n5245a", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Print the instrument ID
print(n5245a.IDN())

# Close the connection
n5245a.close()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and connects to the Keysight N5245A Network Analyzer using the `Keysight_N5245A` driver from the Qcodes library. It then prints the instrument ID and closes the connection.
