To connect to a KEYSIGHT B1500A Spectrum Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.keysightb1500.KeysightB1500 import KeysightB1500

# Create an instance of the KeysightB1500 instrument
instrument = KeysightB1500('b1500', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

In this code, replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your KEYSIGHT B1500A Spectrum Analyzer.
