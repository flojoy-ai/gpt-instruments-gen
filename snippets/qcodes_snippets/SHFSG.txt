Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a SHFSG RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import SHFSG

# Connect to the SHFSG RF Signal Generator
shfsg = SHFSG("shfsg", "dev1234")

# Print the available trigger inputs
print(shfsg.sgchannels[0].awg.available_trigger_inputs())

# Configure the RF output of channel 1
shfsg.sgchannels[0].configure_channel(
    enable=True,
    output_range=0,
    center_frequency=1e9,
    rf_path=True
)

# Enable the sequencer of channel 1
shfsg.sgchannels[0].awg.enable_sequencer(single=False)

# Load a sequencer program to channel 1
sequencer_program = """
    const AWG_CHANNEL = 0
    wave w1 = gauss(64, 0.1, 0.5)
    playWave(w1, AWG_CHANNEL)
"""
shfsg.sgchannels[0].awg.load_sequencer_program(sequencer_program)

# Enable the AWG output of channel 1
shfsg.sgchannels[0].awg.enable(True)

# Disconnect from the SHFSG RF Signal Generator
shfsg.close()
```

This script connects to a SHFSG RF Signal Generator with the name "dev1234" and sets up the RF output of channel 1. It then enables the sequencer, loads a sequencer program, and enables the AWG output of channel 1. Finally, it disconnects from the SHFSG RF Signal Generator.
