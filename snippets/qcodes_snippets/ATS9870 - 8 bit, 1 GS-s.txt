To connect to an ATS9870 board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9870 import AlazarTech_ATS9870

# Create an instance of the ATS9870 driver
ats9870 = AlazarTech_ATS9870('ats9870', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Connect to the board
ats9870.connect()

# Now you can use the board for data acquisition and other operations
# For example, you can set the sample rate
ats9870.sample_rate(1_000_000_000)

# Disconnect from the board
ats9870.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to provide the correct path to the `ATSApi.dll` file in the `dll_path` argument of the `AlazarTech_ATS9870` constructor.
