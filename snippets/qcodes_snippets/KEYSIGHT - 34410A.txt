To connect to a KEYSIGHT - 34410A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344XXA import Keysight_344XXA

# Create an instance of the Keysight_344XXA driver
multimeter = Keysight_344XXA('multimeter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform measurements or set parameters using the multimeter object

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

This script imports the `Keysight_344XXA` driver from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight` module. It then creates an instance of the driver, specifying a name for the instrument and the VISA resource address of the multimeter.

The `connect()` method is called to establish a connection to the multimeter. You can then perform measurements or set parameters using the methods and properties provided by the `multimeter` object.

Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to close the connection to the multimeter.
