```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight_344xxA

# Create an instance of the instrument
multimeter = Keysight_344xxA("multimeter", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
multimeter.connect()

# Perform a DC voltage measurement
voltage_dc = multimeter.voltage_dc()

# Print the measurement result
print("DC Voltage:", voltage_dc)

# Disconnect from the instrument
multimeter.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `Keysight_344xxA` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA` module.
2. Create an instance of the instrument by calling `Keysight_344xxA("multimeter", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")`. Replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the appropriate address of your instrument.
3. Connect to the instrument by calling `multimeter.connect()`.
4. Perform a DC voltage measurement by calling `multimeter.voltage_dc()`.
5. Print the measurement result by calling `print("DC Voltage:", voltage_dc)`.
6. Disconnect from the instrument by calling `multimeter.disconnect()`.
