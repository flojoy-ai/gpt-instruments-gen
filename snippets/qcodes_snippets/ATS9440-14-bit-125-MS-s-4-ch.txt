Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to an ATS9440-14 bit, 125 MS/s, 4 ch DAQ board:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9440 import AlazarTechATS9440

# Connect to the ATS9440 board
daq = AlazarTechATS9440('daq', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Print the available parameters
print(daq.parameters)

# Set the clock source to INTERNAL_CLOCK
daq.clock_source('INTERNAL_CLOCK')

# Set the sample rate to 125 MS/s
daq.sample_rate(125_000_000)

# Set the channel range for channel 1 to 0.1V
daq.channel_range1(0.1)

# Set the channel range for channel 2 to 0.1V
daq.channel_range2(0.1)

# Set the channel range for channel 3 to 0.1V
daq.channel_range3(0.1)

# Set the channel range for channel 4 to 0.1V
daq.channel_range4(0.1)

# Set other parameters as needed

# Close the connection to the board
daq.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll'` with the correct path to the ATSApi.dll file on your system.
