To connect to a AWG70001B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A driver
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the AWG70000A methods and parameters to control the instrument
# For example, you can set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# You can also play a waveform or sequence
awg.play()

# Disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your AWG70001B RF Signal Generator.
