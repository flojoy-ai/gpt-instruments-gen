Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a TPS2012 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.TPS2012 import TPS2012

# Create an instance of the TPS2012 instrument
scope = TPS2012("scope", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
scope.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print("Instrument ID:", scope.IDN())

# Set the horizontal scale to 1 ms/div
scope.horizontal_scale(1e-3)

# Set the trigger type to EDGE and the trigger source to CH1
scope.trigger_type("EDGE")
scope.trigger_source("CH1")

# Start the acquisition
scope.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
scope.wait_for_acquisition()

# Get the waveform data from channel 1
data = scope.channels.ch1.curvedata()

# Print the first 10 data points
print("Waveform data:", data[:10])

# Stop the acquisition
scope.stop()

# Disconnect from the instrument
scope.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `TPS2012` instrument, connects to it, and performs various operations such as setting the horizontal scale, trigger type, and trigger source. It then starts the acquisition, waits for it to complete, and retrieves the waveform data from channel 1. Finally, it stops the acquisition and disconnects from the instrument.
