Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a TPS2012 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.TPS2012 import TPS2012

# Create an instance of the TPS2012 instrument
scope = TPS2012("scope", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
scope.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print(scope.IDN())

# Set the horizontal scale to 1 ms/div
scope.horizontal_scale(1e-3)

# Set the trigger type to EDGE
scope.trigger_type("EDGE")

# Set the trigger source to CH1
scope.trigger_source("CH1")

# Start the acquisition
scope.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
scope.wait_for_acquisition()

# Get the waveform data from channel 1
data = scope.channels.ch1.curvedata()

# Disconnect from the instrument
scope.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your TPS2012 Oscilloscope.
