To connect to a KEYSIGHT 34980A DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_34980A import Keysight34980A

# Create an instance of the instrument
daq = Keysight34980A('daq', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
daq.connect()

# Perform operations on the instrument
daq.reset()
daq.disconnect_all()

# Disconnect from the instrument
daq.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `Keysight34980A` instrument with the name 'daq' and the specified address ('TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'). It then connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method.

After connecting, you can perform various operations on the instrument, such as resetting it (`reset()`) and disconnecting all connections (`disconnect_all()`).

Finally, you can disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
