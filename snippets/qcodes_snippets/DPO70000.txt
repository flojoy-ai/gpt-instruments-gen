Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a DPO70000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division for channel 1
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)

# Acquire a waveform from channel 1
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()

# Plot the waveform
waveform.plot()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "1.2.3.4" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots the waveform. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
