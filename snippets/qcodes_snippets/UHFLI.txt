Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a UHFLI Lockin Amplifier:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import UHFLI

# Connect to the UHFLI Lockin Amplifier
uhfli = UHFLI("uhfli", "dev1234")

# Print the available AWG channels
print(uhfli.awgs.channels)

# Enable the sequencer on AWG channel 0
uhfli.awgs[0].enable_sequencer(single=True)

# Wait until the AWG is finished
uhfli.awgs[0].wait_done()

# Compile and load a sequencer program
sequencer_program = """
    const N = 1000;
    wave w = ones(N);
    playWave(w);
"""
uhfli.awgs[0].compile_sequencer_program(sequencer_program)
uhfli.awgs[0].load_sequencer_program(sequencer_program)

# Write waveforms to the waveform memory
waveforms = qc.Waveforms()
waveforms["w1"] = [0, 1, 0, -1]
waveforms["w2"] = [1, 0, -1, 0]
uhfli.awgs[0].write_to_waveform_memory(waveforms)

# Read waveforms from the waveform memory
read_waveforms = uhfli.awgs[0].read_from_waveform_memory()
print(read_waveforms)

# Disconnect from the UHFLI Lockin Amplifier
uhfli.close()
```

Note: Replace `"dev1234"` with the actual device ID or address of your UHFLI Lockin Amplifier.
